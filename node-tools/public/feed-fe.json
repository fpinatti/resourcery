You&#8217;ll learn how to learn quickly, supercharge your personal growth, and stand out from the crowd without having to spend every living minute bent over text books.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"onekeyskill\">One Key Skill</h2>\n<p>What would you say if I told you there&#8217;s a skill that could benefit anyone, any place, any time? Something that would accelerate your progress no matter what career path you chose, indifferent to technological disruptions? </p>\n<p>Does that sound too good to be true? Well, here&#8217;s the pitch: in a world that&#8217;s changing faster than ever, you need to adapt quickly and constantly. That requires the willingness to change, and the ability to learn. Learning quickly — and becoming a life-long learner — should become your new superpower. You won&#8217;t be able to stop the world from changing, but with this ability to adapt, you&#8217;ll be the first to embrace change and leverage it for your own benefit — and you&#8217;ll also amaze potential employers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatitmeanstolearnquickly\">What It Means to Learn Quickly</h2>\n<p>When we think about quick learners, we might remember those few people back in our school and university days who just seemed to breeze through class. Or we&#8217;ll remember that memory champion with the unique ability to somehow remember not just the first six digits of pi (3.14159 btw) <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/smarter-living/train-your-brain-like-a-memory-champion.html\">but 65,536</a>. Sixty-five thousand! What an impressive feat. These people surely are special. Or they must practice all day, every day.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, though: you can learn this skill too. There&#8217;s no superpower, reserved for a few gifted people, or something that can only be achieved with pills and supplements. Good news, huh?</p>\n<p>Being a fast learner simply comes down to knowing how your brain (and body!) work and how to tailor your study activities accordingly. Everyone can do it. It&#8217;s a skill. Here&#8217;s how.</p>\n<h2 id=\"manageenergynottime\">Manage Energy, Not Time</h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t bother with time management. Manage your energy. First things first: it doesn&#8217;t really matter how much time you spend learning.</p>\n<p>There, I said it. Pulling an all-nighter before your exams, participating in a 12-hour-YouTube-study-with-me session, or starring at your books long after midnight, aren&#8217;t just unnecessary. They actively sabotage your progress.</p>\n<p>Sure, you need to invest time to learn a new skill. But even more importantly, you need to invest energy.</p>\n<p>Think of energy as the most relevant resource in your learning endeavor. Your brain&#8217;s ability to grasp new concepts or to come up with new ideas doesn&#8217;t so much hinge on the time you spend on taking notes, but on your state of mind and available energy while doing so.</p>\n<p>And energy is a finite resource. It helps to imagine your energy levels as something similar to your bank account. You&#8217;ve got a certain amount in there (hopefully) and maybe also some allowance for withdrawals beyond that. But at some point, you&#8217;ll have to recharge things or you&#8217;ll run out of steam.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1stopsabotagingyourownsuccess\">1. Stop sabotaging your own success</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re one of the <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/160265#1\">20% of American students who routinely pull an all-nighter</a> during semester time, you should know that <a href=\"https://www.med.upenn.edu/csi/the-impact-of-sleep-on-learning-and-memory.html\">science thinks very little of this strategy</a> for improving your output. To the contrary, sleep deprivation is linked to poorer performance across the bench and will likely hinder your long-term memory formation.</p>\n<p>So while all-nighters make for good stories, they won&#8217;t do much for you in terms of learning effectively (and sustainably).</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, because we&#8217;re so used to measuring our study efforts by time, we start using these crazy long sessions as benchmarks for us to achieve again, leaving us disappointed and frustrated whenever we don&#8217;t reach them.</p>\n<p>Instead of measuring the quantity of study time, we should prioritize the quality. Put in a few hours of high energy work in each day and you&#8217;ll vastly outperform your former night-shift-zombie-self.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2howtoactuallylearninyoursleep\">2. How to actually learn in your sleep</h3>\n<p>I have some bad news for you: if you&#8217;re hoping to learn something passively in your sleep by playing a lecture in the background, it&#8217;s not going to work. This hack to boost your learning <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140721-how-to-learn-while-you-sleep\">has failed the scientific test</a>.</p>\n<p>The good news, however, is that you really <em>can</em> learn in your sleep. It just works slightly differently. So-called slow wave or <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180815-why-sleep-should-be-every-students-priority\">non-REM sleep cycles help your brain to turn short-term inputs into long-term memories</a>. What&#8217;s more, this process helps your brain find patterns and connections with existing ideas, thus increasing your creative problem solving potentials.</p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t stop there. <a href=\"https://www.med.upenn.edu/csi/the-impact-of-sleep-on-learning-and-memory.html\">Sleep also helps you reset your brain&#8217;s capacity to take in new information</a>. So the next time you&#8217;re feeling like your head is filled to the brim and you just can&#8217;t practice any more, consider taking a break to nap or get a good night&#8217;s sleep.</p>\n<p>So while you can&#8217;t use your sleep time to put more information into your brain, a good sleep is crucial to sort through what you&#8217;ve learned during the day and to make sure that you retain it long-term.</p>\n<p>If you struggle with this, here are some ideas for getting more sleep:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No caffeine after 2pm.</strong> While the effect of caffeine sets in nearly immediately after drinking, it <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/15496-caffeine-how-to-hack-it-and-how-to-quit-it#:~:text=The%20level%20of%20caffeine%20in,clear%20caffeine%20from%20your%20bloodstream.\">remains for hours in your system</a>. Six hours after consumption, half of the caffeine will still remain and affect your sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Establish a night and morning routine.</strong> A night-time routine signals to your body that it&#8217;s time to power down. And the proper morning routine sets you up for success and ensures you don&#8217;t spend your first hour after waking up doom-scrolling (and no, checking your social media in a specific order doesn&#8217;t count as a morning routine).</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid highly stimulating activities before bed.</strong> Help your body (and brain) to get into night mode and don&#8217;t pump up the energy levels close to bed time. Things to avoid include intense workouts, energizing music, heavy food, exhilarating readings or all-too-tense TV shows.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve your sleeping environment</strong>. While many factors contribute to a good night&#8217;s sleep and not everyone can splurge on the latest mattress trend, there are lots of things you can easily implement to get a good sleep. Most importantly, have a dark room with no or minimal light sources. If needed, invest in some light-blocking curtains (there are lots of very affordable options). And ideally, leave your phone outside the bedroom.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- STOCK IMAGE SLEEP --></p>\n<h2 id=\"improveyourfocus\">Improve Your Focus</h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve got your energy levels up and stabilized, and you&#8217;ve had a good night&#8217;s sleep, it&#8217;s time to turn your focus to … your focus.</p>\n<p>“Focus” in this context means your ability to actually sit down and study a topic. It&#8217;s the skill that stops you from cleaning up your room for the third time this week instead of tackling that new chapter in the book.</p>\n<p>No matter how much energy you&#8217;ve got, if you can&#8217;t channel it into your learning project, if won&#8217;t be of much use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3youneedatomato\">3. You need a tomato</h3>\n<p>A tomato will actually will help your learning skills. The so called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\">Pomodoro Technique</a> (pomodoro is the Italian word for tomato) is named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer used by its inventor.</p>\n<p>Using a timer also happens to be a very effective approach for supercharging your study sessions.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set your timer for 25 minutes. (It doesn&#8217;t have to be shaped like a tomato, but it would be kinda cool.)</li>\n<li>Study. Don&#8217;t interrupt your learning session for anything. It&#8217;s just 25 minutes. Pretty much anything can wait until you&#8217;re done.</li>\n<li>Once the timer rings, stop immediately. This trains your brain to expect clear borders between study time and break time and makes it more likely to actually focus during the 25 minutes.</li>\n<li>Take a quick break of five minutes. Avoid overly stimulating activities (so ideally, don&#8217;t start scrolling social media). Instead, stretch a bit, watch your breathing or de-clutter the sixteen coffee mugs that have somehow accumulated on your desk.</li>\n<li>Repeat two or three more times before taking a longer break.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why does it work?</p>\n<p>Multitasking is a myth. Your brain isn&#8217;t wired to do two things at a time. Instead, it quickly switches between tasks. And each switch costs mental bandwidth. Context switching takes a much bigger toll than we assume. Quickly answering a text during your study session doesn&#8217;t just cost two minutes. Research shows that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/opinion/sunday/a-focus-on-distraction.html\">it can take up to 25 minutes to get back into a focused state</a>.</p>\n<p>But when we decide to study for the next two hours, it&#8217;s hard to fight back distractions constantly. Instead, it&#8217;s easy to pick up the phone to &#8220;just quickly check my messages&#8221; or respond to that one semi-urgent email you know is sitting in your inbox.</p>\n<p>So instead of hoping that you&#8217;ll somehow manage to stay focused for two hours despite countless possible interruptions, create smaller, more intense study sessions and learn to clearly distinguish between study and break time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4fightprocrastinationwiththefiveminuterule\">4. Fight procrastination with the five-minute rule</h3>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://nesslabs.com/procrastination-triggers\">many potential reasons for procrastination</a>. A task might be perceived as too difficult or too unstructured. Or it might simply bore you. But whatever it is, our internal resistance is usually strongest before we start a task.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s where the five-minute rule comes in. It&#8217;s a simple trick to convince yourself and it will work, even if you know that you&#8217;re about to trick yourself.</p>\n<p>The next time you feel procrastination creeping in, make a deal with yourself to get started on the task for five minutes only. After those few minutes, you&#8217;re allowed to stop and do something else. Chances are, though, that you&#8217;ll continue with the task at hand because you&#8217;ve already moved past the first hurdle and gained some momentum.</p>\n<p>It also pairs neatly with the Pomodoro Technique. Whereas the Pomodoro Technique is geared towards reducing distractions during your work sessions, the five-minute rule is the ignition for each individual session.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-learn-quickly/?utm_source=rss\">How to Learn Quickly: 10 Proven Methods for Mastering Any Skill</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

After you&#8217;ve built the GitHub tracker by following this tutorial, you&#8217;ll have learned how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add a service worker and convert the tracker to a <a href=\"https://web.dev/pwa\">PWA</a></li>\n<li>subscribe to push notifications</li>\n<li>use the <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a> API</li>\n<li>send push events through <a href=\"https://vercel.com\">Vercel</a> cloud functions</li>\n<li>periodically fetch new issues using <a href=\"https://easycron.io\">EasyCron</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>There are a few skills and services you&#8217;ll need to follow this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org\">Node.js</a> and npm installed</li>\n<li>prior <a href=\"https://svelte.dev\">Svelte</a> knowledge</li>\n<li>a free <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a> account, since we&#8217;re using the <a href=\"https://api.github.com\">GitHub API</a></li>\n<li>a free <a href=\"https://cloud.mongodb.com\">MongoDB Atlas</a> account to use MongoDB in the cloud</li>\n<li>a free <a href=\"https://vercel.com\">Vercel</a> account to deploy the application and for cloud functions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatarepushnotifications\">What are Push Notifications?</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at what these so called &#8220;push notifications&#8221; are.</p>\n<p>You must be familiar with regular notifications. These are little bubbles of text that appear on your screen to <em>notify</em> you of something. Push notifications are similar, except that they <em>aren&#8217;t generated on-demand</em>, but they <em>are generated upon receiving push events</em>. Push notifications work <em>when an app is closed</em>, while regular notifications require you to have the app open.</p>\n<p>Push notifications are supported in modern web browsers like Chrome by using something called service workers. Service workers are little pieces of JavaScript that run separately from the browser&#8217;s main thread, and as a result, can run offline if your app is installed as a PWA (progressive web application).</p>\n<p>Push notifications are used in chat applications to notify users when they have unread messages, in games, to notify users of game events, in news sites, to notify users of breaking articles, and for many other purposes.</p>\n<p>There are four steps to show push notifications in your app:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>request permission with <code>window.Notification.requestPermission()</code></li>\n<li>convert your app to a PWA and install it</li>\n<li>subscribe to push events</li>\n<li>upon receiving a push event, send the notification</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"step1creatingthetracker\">Step 1: Creating the Tracker</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s use Svelte with <a href=\"https://vitejs.com\">Vite.js</a> instead of Rollup in this article. Vite is, as its name suggests, faster than Rollup, and also provides built-in support for environment variables. To create a new project with Svelte and Vite, run this command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"shell language-shell\">npm init vite\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Select the framework to be <code>svelte</code>. You can use TypeScript if you want. I&#8217;ll be using regular JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Next, <code>cd</code> into the project folder and you can add <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com\">TailwindCSS</a> to your application and install all dependencies with these commands:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"shell language-shell\">npx svelte-add tailwindcss\r\n\r\n# Install packages\r\nyarn install # or npm install\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, open the project in your favorite code editor and run <code>npm run dev</code> or <code>yarn dev</code> to start the application on <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howthetrackerwillwork\">How the tracker will work</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll use the GitHub API to get a list of issues and pull requests for a repository that the user has tracked. A user&#8217;s tracked repositories and their username will be stored in the MongoDB database.</p>\n<p>The first step would be to prompt the user for their username. Create <code>src/lib/UsernamePrompt.svelte</code>, which will be the component that will do so. Here&#8217;s my UI for the form, but you can design it however you want:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;script&gt;\r\n  let username = \"\";\r\n  async function submit() {\r\n    // TODO\r\n  }\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;form\r\n  on:submit|preventDefault=\"{submit}\"\r\n  class=\"mx-auto min-w-[350px] max-w-[1100px] w-[50%] border border-gray-500 rounded my-4 px-6 py-4\"\r\n&gt;\r\n  &lt;h1 class=\"text-center text-3xl m-4\"&gt;Enter a username&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n  &lt;p class=\"text-center text-xl m-4\"&gt;Enter a username to use this tracker&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;input\r\n    type=\"text\"\r\n    class=\"rounded px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 w-full outline-none\"\r\n    placeholder=\"Username\"\r\n    aria-label=\"Username\"\r\n    bind:value=\"{username}\"\r\n  /&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;button\r\n    class=\"mt-4 border border-transparent bg-blue-500 text-white rounded px-4 py-2 w-full\"\r\n  &gt;\r\n    Submit\r\n  &lt;/button&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Add this component in <code>App.svelte</code> like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;script&gt;\r\n  import UsernamePrompt from \"./lib/UsernamePrompt.svelte\";\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;UsernamePrompt /&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, let&#8217;s add the main tracker UI. Create file <code>src/lib/Tracker.svelte</code> and add the below code in it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;script&gt;\r\n  let repo = \"\";\r\n  function track() {\r\n    // TODO\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function untrack(repo) {\r\n    // TODO\r\n  }\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;form\r\n  on:submit|preventDefault={track}\r\n  class=\"mx-auto min-w-[350px] max-w-[1100px] w-[50%] border border-gray-500 rounded my-4 px-6 py-4\"\r\n&gt;\r\n  &lt;h1 class=\"text-center text-3xl m-4\"&gt;GitHub tracker&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;input\r\n    type=\"text\"\r\n    class=\"rounded px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 w-full outline-none\"\r\n    placeholder=\"Enter the repository's URL\"\r\n    aria-label=\"Repository URL\"\r\n    bind:value={repo}\r\n  /&gt;\r\n  &lt;button\r\n    class=\"mt-2 border border-transparent bg-blue-500 text-white rounded px-4 py-2 w-full\"\r\n    &gt;Track repository&lt;/button\r\n  &gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;h2 class=\"mt-4 text-2xl\"&gt;Tracked repositories&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n  &lt;ul class=\"m-2 list-decimal\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- We'll use a loop to automatically add repositories here later on. --&gt;\r\n    &lt;li class=\"py-1 flex items-center justify-between\"&gt;\r\n      &lt;a class=\"text-gray-500 hover:underline\" href=\"https://github.com/test/test\"\r\n        &gt;https://github.com/test/test&lt;/a\r\n      &gt;\r\n      &lt;button class=\"text-red-500 cursor-pointer\" on:click={() =&gt; untrack(\"\")}\r\n        &gt;Untrack&lt;/button\r\n      &gt;\r\n    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>To test out your component, <em>temporarily</em> swap out the <code>UsernamePrompt</code> component for the new <code>Tracker</code> component in <code>App.svelte</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;script&gt;\r\n  // import UsernamePrompt from \"./lib/UsernamePrompt.svelte\";\r\n  import Tracker from \"./lib/Tracker.svelte\";\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- &lt;UsernamePrompt /&gt; --&gt;\r\n&lt;Tracker /&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Your screen should now look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636588960installed-app.png\" alt=\"The new tracker component\" /></p>\n<p><em>Note: remember to restore <code>App.svelte</code> to its previous code!</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"step2settingupcloudfunctions\">Step 2: Setting up Cloud Functions</h2>\n<p>We need to have a back-end server to send push events to our application. This means that you need to create a new (maybe) ExpressJS project, and then deploy that separately. This will all be a headache for someone just experimenting with push notifications.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/introduction\">Vercel Cloud Functions</a> to the rescue! Cloud functions are like Express routes. They can run code and give you a response when you fetch its URL. Vercel has support for cloud functions; you just have to create files in the <code>api</code> folder. You&#8217;ll be using cloud functions to interact with MongoDB, since exposing secrets client-side is <strong>never</strong> a good thing.</p>\n<p>First, make sure you have a Cluster in <a href=\"https://cloud.mongodb.com\">MongoDB Atlas</a>. MongoDB has a free plan (<em>M0</em>), so be sure to create one if you haven&#8217;t already. Now, go to the <strong>Database Access</strong> tab in the sidebar of your Atlas dashboard. Add a new Database User by clicking the <strong>green</strong> button on the right side. Enter in the user&#8217;s details (don&#8217;t forget the password), and create the user.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636588523new-user.png\" alt=\"Creating a new Atlas user\" /></p>\n<p>To connect to the database, you&#8217;ll need the connection string. Save the new user and password somewhere and head to your Cluster&#8217;s Overview. Click the <strong>Connect</strong> button on the right side and select <strong>Connect your Application</strong> as the method of connection. You should see a connection string similar to the one below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636588547connect-cluster.png\" alt=\"Connection string\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you have the connection string, you can connect to your database, but first, you need to deploy the current application to <a href=\"https://vercel.com\">Vercel</a>. The easiest way to do this is using <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Create a new <a href=\"https://github.com/new\">GitHub repository</a> and push your code to it. Next, head to your <a href=\"https://vercel.com/dashboard\">Vercel Dashboard</a> and click the <strong>New Project</strong> button. Import your GitHub Repository, make sure the framework is <strong>Vite</strong>, and add an environment variable called <code>MONGODB_URL</code>. Set its value to the connection string of the MongoDB database.</p>\n<p>Once your website has been deployed, you need to change your local development command from <code>yarn dev</code> to <code>vercel dev</code>. Upon running the command, if you&#8217;re asked to link to an existing project, click <strong>yes</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: make sure to install the Vercel CLI with <code>npm i -g vercel</code> if you haven&#8217;t already.</em></p>\n<p>Like me, if you run into a problem with using <code>vite</code> with <code>vercel dev</code>, be sure to change the <em>Development Command</em> of your project to <code>vite --port $PORT</code> from <code>vite</code> in the <a href=\"https://vercel.com/dashboard\">Vercel Dashboard</a>.</p>\n<p>This will allow us to use cloud functions with the correct environment variables locally.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s add a helper file that will allow us to access MongoDB without opening up too many connections. Create file <code>api/_mongo.js</code> and put the following code in it. A file in the <code>api</code> directory that is prefixed with a <code>_</code> will <em>not</em> be treated as a cloud function. This allows us to add helpers and other logic in separate files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const { MongoClient } = require(\"mongodb\");\r\n\r\nconst mongo = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URL);\r\n\r\n// Export the connection promise\r\nexport default mongo.connect();\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Exporting the connection promise instead of the main client itself will prevent us from having redundant connections, since we&#8217;re working in a serverless platform.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usingcommonjsinsteadofesmodules\">Using CommonJS instead of ESModules</h3>\n<p>Notice how I am using <code>require</code> instead of <code>import</code>? This is because, as of the time of writing, Vercel Cloud Functions <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> support ESModule <code>import</code> statements in JavaScript files. Instead, you need to use CommonJS <code>require</code> statements.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s one problem here. If you see the <code>package.json</code> of our app, you&#8217;ll notice that it has a line <code>\"type\": \"module\"</code>. This means that each JavaScript file in the project is an EsModule. This is not what we want, so to mark all files in the <code>api</code> directory as CommonJS files, so we can use the <code>require</code> statement, create <code>api/package.json</code> and add this line in it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\r\n  \"type\": \"commonjs\"\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will now allow us to use <code>require</code> statements in the <code>api</code> directory. Install the MongoDB connection driver with this command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"shell language-shell\"># Don't forget to CD!\r\ncd api\r\nnpm i mongodb # or use yarn\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"step3addingfunctionality\">Step 3: Adding functionality</h2>\n<p>The tracker, as of now, doesn&#8217;t really work, so let&#8217;s fix that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authentication\">Authentication</h3>\n<p>For authentication, we need to store the username that the user has input in the MongoDB database.</p>\n<p>Create a file <code>/api/storeusername.js</code>. This will be a cloud function and will be mapped to <code>http://localhost:3000/api/storeusername</code>. Put the below code in it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const mongoPromise = require(\"../src/lib/mongo\");\r\n// All cloud functions must export a function that takes a req and res object.\r\n// These objects are similar to their express counterparts.\r\nmodule.exports = async (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n  // TODO\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, get the MongoDB client like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">module.exports = async (req, res) =&gt;\r\n  // Wait for the client to connect\r\n  const mongo = await mongoPromise;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Extract the <code>username</code> from the request&#8217;s body:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// ...\r\nconst { username } = req.body;\r\n\r\n// Check if the username is valid\r\nif (typeof username !== \"string\" || !username.trim()) {\r\n  res.status(400).json({ message: \"Please send the username\" });\r\n  return;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, you need to store this username in the database:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// Get the collection\r\nconst usersCol = mongo.db().collection(\"users\");\r\n// Check if the username already exists in the database\r\nif (await usersCol.findOne({ _id: username })) {\r\n  res.status(400).json({ message: \"User already exists!\" });\r\n  return;\r\n}\r\n// We want the username to be the identifier of the user\r\nawait usersCol.insertOne({ _id: username });\r\n\r\n// Everything went well :)\r\nres.status(200).json({ message: \"Username recorded\" });\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, this is how the <code>api/storeusername.js</code> file should look:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const mongoPromise = require(\"./_mongo\");\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = async (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n  const mongo = await mongoPromise;\r\n\r\n  const { username } = req.body;\r\n  if (typeof username !== \"string\" || !username.trim()) {\r\n    res.status(400).json({ message: \"Please send the username\" });\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Get the collection\r\n  const usersCol = mongo.db().collection(\"users\");\r\n\r\n  // Check if the username already exists in the database\r\n  if (await usersCol.findOne({ _id: username })) {\r\n    res.status(400).json({ message: \"User already exists!\" });\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // We want the username to be the identifier of the user\r\n  await usersCol.insertOne({ _id: username });\r\n\r\n  // Everything went well :)\r\n  res.status(200).json({ message: \"Username recorded\" });\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Deploy your application to Vercel with <code>vercel .</code>, or by pushing to GitHub, and your serverless function should be live! You can test it using cURL with this command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"shell language-shell\">curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"username\": \"test\"}' https://your-app.vercel.app/api/storeusername\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This should create a new document in the <code>users</code> collection with the <code>_id</code> field being the username we just gave.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636588582users-collection.png\" alt=\"The users collection in Atlas\" /></p>\n<p>Now all that&#8217;s left is to fetch this function on the front end. In <code>src/lib/UsernamePrompt.svelte</code>, in the <code>submit</code> function, first you need to send a request to the cloud function, and then put the username in <code>localStorage</code>, so we know that the user is authenticated. You can send requests with the <code>fetch</code> function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">async function submit() {\r\n  const res = await fetch(\"/api/storeusername\", {\r\n    body: JSON.stringify({ username }),\r\n    headers: {\r\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\r\n    },\r\n    method: \"POST\",\r\n  });\r\n  const data = await res.json();\r\n  if (!res.ok) alert(data.message);\r\n  else {\r\n    // Store the username in localStorage\r\n    localStorage.setItem(\"username\", username);\r\n    // Reload the page\r\n    window.location.reload();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re reloading the page, because in <code>App.svelte</code>, when the page is loaded, we need to check if there is a username in <code>localStorage</code>. If there is, we can skip the <code>UsernamePrompt</code> screen. To do so, add this code in the <code>script</code> tag of <code>App.svelte</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;script&gt;\r\n  import { onMount } from \"svelte\";\r\n  import UsernamePrompt from \"./lib/UsernamePrompt.svelte\";\r\n  import Tracker from \"./lib/Tracker.svelte\";\r\n\r\n  let isLoggedIn = false;\r\n  onMount(() =&gt; {\r\n    // If there is a username in the localStorage, set isLoggedIn to true\r\n    isLoggedIn = !!localStorage.getItem(\"username\");\r\n  });\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above code will check the <code>localStorage</code> for a username and set <code>isLoggedIn</code> to <code>true</code> if it exists. Next, all we have to do is update the DOM. Right under the <code>script</code> tag of <code>App.svelte</code>, add this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">{#if !isLoggedIn}\r\n&lt;UsernamePrompt /&gt;\r\n{:else}\r\n&lt;Tracker /&gt;\r\n{/if}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"trackinganduntrackingrepositories\">Tracking and untracking repositories</h3>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s add the functionality for the actual tracking features of the tracker. If you open <code>Tracker.svelte</code>, you&#8217;ll notice there are two functions — <code>track()</code> and <code>untrack()</code>. These functions should track and untrack repositories respectively, by adding them to the database.</p>\n<p>But before that, you need to add a few more cloud functions. One to track a repository, another to untrack, and one last to get a user&#8217;s tracked repositories.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s work on them one by one.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/create-a-github-tracker-with-push-notifications-in-svelte/?utm_source=rss\">Create a GitHub Tracker with Push Notifications in Svelte</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Some people refer to it as a “safety net,” while I like to think of it as Git’s &#8220;diary.&#8221; That’s because Git uses it to keep a journal about every movement of the <code>HEAD</code> pointer (i.e. every time you commit, merge, rebase, cherry-pick, reset, etc.). Git logs your actions in the Reflog which makes it a valuable logbook and a good starting point when something went wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this last part of our “Advanced Git” series, I&#8217;ll explain the differences between <code>git log</code> and <code>git reflog</code>, and I&#8217;ll show you how to use the Reflog to recover deleted commits as well as deleted branches.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group ticss-c35bb282\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h4 id=\"h-advanced-git-series\">Advanced Git series:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Part 1:</strong> <a href=\"/creating-the-perfect-commit-in-git\"></a><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/creating-the-perfect-commit-in-git/\">Creating the Perfect Commit in Git</a></li><li><strong>Part 2:</strong> <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/branching-strategies-in-git/\">Branching Strategies in Git</a></li><li><strong>Part 3:</strong> <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-collaboration-with-pull-requests/\">Better Collaboration With Pull Requests</a></li><li><strong>Part 4:</strong> <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/merge-conflicts-what-they-are-and-how-to-deal-with-them\">Merge Conflicts</a></li><li><strong>Part 5:</strong> <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/rebase-vs-merge-integrating-changes-in-git\">Rebase vs. Merge</a> </li><li><strong>Part 6:</strong> <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/interactive-rebase-clean-up-your-commit-history\">Interactive Rebase</a></li><li><strong>Part 7:</strong> <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/cherry-picking-commits-in-git\">Cherry-Picking Commits in Git</a></li><li><strong>Part 8:</strong> <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/using-the-reflog-to-restore-lost-commits\">Using the Reflog to Restore Lost Commits</a> (<em><em>You are here!</em></em>)</li></ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-git-log-or-git-reflog-what-s-the-difference\"><code>git log</code> or <code>git reflog</code>: what&#8217;s the difference?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In previous articles, I&#8217;ve recommended you use the <code>git log</code> command to inspect previous events and look at your commit history, and that&#8217;s exactly what it does. It shows the current <code>HEAD</code> and its ancestors, i.e. its parent, the next parent in line, etc. The log goes all the way back in the commit history by recursively printing every commit&#8217;s parent. It&#8217;s part of the repository which means it gets replicated after you push, fetch, or pull.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>git reflog</code>, on the other hand, is a private and workspace-related recording. It doesn&#8217;t go through the list of ancestors. Instead, it shows an ordered list of all commits which <code>HEAD</code> has pointed to in the past. That&#8217;s why you can think of it as some kind of “undo history” like you might see in word processors, text editors, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This local recording technically isn&#8217;t part of the repository and it&#8217;s stored separately from the commits. The Reflog is a file in <code>.git/logs/refs/heads/</code> and it tracks the local commits for every branch. Git&#8217;s diary usually gets cleaned up after 90 days (that&#8217;s the default setting), but you can easily adjust the expiration date of the Reflog. To change the number of days to 180, simply type the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"Terminal\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">$ git config gc.reflogExpire 180.days.ago</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1506\" height=\"714\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=1506%2C714&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of a Terminal with a light yellow background and black text.

Tools like code editors can help us along with syntax suggestions, snippets, debugging suggestions, and so on. But what if we had a tool that used artificial intelligence (AI) to help us write much more substantial portions of code? That&#8217;s what GitHub Copilot is all about.</strong></p>\n<p>I was recently scrolling through Twitter when I saw this tweet from the official GitHub account:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Meet GitHub Copilot &#8211; your AI pair programmer. <a href=\"https://t.co/eWPueAXTFt\">https://t.co/eWPueAXTFt</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NPua5K2vFS\">pic.twitter.com/NPua5K2vFS</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; GitHub (@github) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/github/status/1409883156333879300?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>I was amazed by the idea of AI helping me to write code (or even do all the heavy work), so I went ahead and visited the <a href=\"https://copilot.github.com/\">GitHub Copilot page</a>.</p>\n<p>Skipping all the content, I went to the bottom of the page searching for a way to test this out. I encountered a banner that was a call to action to sign up for GitHub Copilot technical preview.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1626408680copilot-singup.png\" alt=\"GitHub copilot announcement\" /></p>\n<p>After some days (or weeks) waiting, I got granted access to the technical preview, and now I can let AI code for me … or can I?</p>\n<p>Read more to learn what GitHub copilot is, my experience with it, and how it&#8217;ll impact you … or why maybe not.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscopilot\">What is Copilot?</h2>\n<p>Simply put, GitHub Copilot is an AI tool that provides you code suggestions based on comments and the context of the file you&#8217;re editing.</p>\n<p>Copilot is the result of a collaboration between GitHub and <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, which is heavily backed by Microsoft. It&#8217;s powered by a brand new AI system named Codex, which is based on the GPT-3 model.</p>\n<p><strong>GPT-3</strong> stands for the third generation of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer — a language model capable of generating sequences of text from simple prompts. Codex is derived from this model, which is capable not only of text, but also code generation in some of the most popular languages.</p>\n<p>Copilot has been trained with billions of lines of code from publicly available repositories on GitHub, so your code has probably improved this AI tool in some way (we&#8217;ll get into details later).</p>\n<p>Although it supports most programming languages, it currently works the best with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Go.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how GitHub Copilot works, and what it&#8217;s currently capable of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"githubcopilotinaction\">GitHub Copilot in Action</h2>\n<p>Copilot is incredibly easy to install. In case you have access to the technical preview, just download the VS Code extension by searching for it on the <strong>Extension</strong> tab and activating it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1628049207copilot-extension.png\" alt=\"GitHub Copilot extension\" /></p>\n<p>It then requires you to log in to your GitHub account, so it can confirm you have access to the technical preview.</p>\n<p>For now, the only way to use Copilot is on VS Code, and it may remain the same for some time according to <a href=\"https://copilot.github.com/#faq-can-i-use-it-in-another-ide-than-visual-studio-code\">Copilot&#8217;s page</a>.</p>\n<p>Most of the following examples will be using Python, since it&#8217;s one of the languages this AI tool is really good with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howcodesuggestionswork\">How Code Suggestions Work</h3>\n<p>GitHub Copilot generates multiple suggestions for you based on the context of the file you&#8217;re editing. Mainly, it gives you suggestions based on the comments you&#8217;ve made in the file, and the code you&#8217;ve written before.</p>\n<p>Once Copilot has a code suggestion, it&#8217;ll ask you to use it. Let&#8217;s test out Copilot by creating a function that computes the average of a dataset. The only thing I&#8217;ll provide to Copilot is a comment and the name of the function.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627262304compute-average.png\" alt=\"Compute average\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, the text in gray is suggested by Copilot, and I can accept it by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>. But if I don&#8217;t like the first suggestion, I can walk through more suggestions with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd>, or see a bunch of solutions from a side panel with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627263113more-solutions.png\" alt=\"More solutions\" /></p>\n<p>Impressive, it isn&#8217;t? But let&#8217;s set a different challenge. Now, Copilot has to create a <code>main</code> function that lets the user enter some space-delimited numbers. It should <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp\">split</a> these numbers and pass the resulting list to the <code>compute_average</code> function, before printing the result.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627262293implement-average-function.png\" alt=\"Implement compute average function\" /></p>\n<p>Lastly, I&#8217;m going to ask Copilot to call the main function using the execution entry point <code>__name__ == '__main__'</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627262519call-main-function.png\" alt=\"Main function\" /></p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s how GitHub Copilot wrote a functional Python script based only on the commands I gave to it. Of course, the code isn&#8217;t perfect. For instance, the <code>compute_average</code> function could be reduced to <code>sum(dataset) / len(dataset)</code>, but the overall result is pretty good.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testingcopilotwithsimpleproblems\">Testing Copilot with Simple Problems</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the function every developer must know: FizzBuzz. I&#8217;ll write the problem statement, name the function and let Copilot do the work</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627264363fizzbuzz.png\" alt=\"FizzBuzz\" /></p>\n<p>What about a leap year function? In this case, I&#8217;ll only provide a simple <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/\">docstring</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627266544leap-year.png\" alt=\"Leap year\" /></p>\n<p>Now, a simple palindrome checker.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1628047570Palindrome.jpeg\" alt=\"Palindrome Checker\" /></p>\n<p>Another neat thing about Copilot is that it can also provide suggestions in comments and docstrings. In the above example, it completed the definition of a palindrome!</p>\n<p>Lastly, a simple password generator. I provided a long description, and the modules I wanted to use. Surprisingly, I got exactly what I wanted.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627267313password-generator.png\" alt=\"Password Generator\" /></p>\n<p>To conclude this section, Copilot is extremely good at suggesting simple, bite-sized solutions from our comments. </p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s test how this AI pair programmer performs in more complex environments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"complexcopilotusage\">Complex Copilot usage</h3>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s use Copilot to solve common algorithms problems. For example, an iterative binary search implementation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627270285binary-search.png\" alt=\"Binary Search\" /></p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t understand the code; at first, I didn&#8217;t either. Here comes one of the downsides of using this kind of tool. You may implement code provided by Copilot without actually understanding its meaning.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see more downsides later, but you should take this into account in case you have access to the technical preview.</p>\n<p>Aside from this, the solution above is excellent (probably extracted from a <abbr title=\"Data Structures &#038; Algorithms\">DSA</abbr>  GitHub repository). It&#8217;s readable code that, with few moments of analysis, I managed to understand.</p>\n<p>But you can&#8217;t always rely on Copilot suggestions. Most of the time you&#8217;ll need to review the suggestions a couple of times before integrating them into your codebase.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve tested Copilot with simple problems and algorithms. It would be a good idea to use it in real-world solutions.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/github-copilot-ai-pair-programming/?utm_source=rss\">What is GitHub Copilot?

It’s easy to write, easy to read, and easily converted to HTML. It empowers writers and bloggers to write without the use of overcomplicated and visually exhausting code.</strong></p>\n<p>The syntax was created by <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">John Gruber</a> in 2004 and became popular in blogs and forums. It’s used on Reddit, Trello, GitHub, Stack Overflow, SourceForge, and Stack Exchange. Chances are, you’re familiar with it already.</p>\n<p>Markdown offers <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/writers-bloggers-can-make-markdown-wordpress/\">a number of benefits to writers and bloggers</a>, but by default, WordPress doesn’t support it. You need to either convert your Markdown to HTML before pasting it into WordPress, or use a plugin.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll cover five of the best Markdown plugins for WordPress. Just to be clear from the beginning: it&#8217;s best to avoid having more than one active at the same time, and to avoid surprises with formatting by using the text editor rather than the visual editor.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s dive in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"markdownpluginsforwordpress\">Markdown Plugins for WordPress</h2>\n<p>Here are five WordPress Markdown plugins that are actively developed and work with recent versions of WordPress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1wpgithubermd\">1. WP Githuber MD</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-githuber-md/\">WP Githuber MD</a> is an all-in-one Markdown plugin that uses GitHub Flavored Markdown. It’s under active development and offers syntax highlighting, a live preview pane, spell check, image paste, and can convert HTML to Markdown. Markdown can be individually enabled or disabled for each post.</p>\n<p>When enabled, your posts are saved in Markdown for ease of editing. The plugin parses the Markdown to HTML and saves the results into <code>wp-posts.post_content</code>. This ensures that your posts will display correctly even if the plugin is turned off.</p>\n<p>A toolbar is offered at the top of the editor. It includes icons for formatting, headers, lists, links, images, and more. When I tested the plugin, I learned that lists are not continued automatically on pressing <kbd>enter</kbd>. A new number, hyphen, or asterisk needs to be typed on each line.</p>\n<p>The plugin is highly rated and updated regularly. It&#8217;s the best WordPress Markdown editor I&#8217;m aware of.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1625894645wpmarkdown-wpgithubermd.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of WP Githuber MD\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"2jetpack\">2. Jetpack</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/features/discussion/markdown/\">Jetpack</a> is a well-known plugin by Automattic that gives self-hosted WordPress installations the same feature set as you find on WordPress.com. And that includes Markdown. The plugin currently follows <a href=\"https://commonmark.org/help/\">CommonMark</a> syntax that supports tables, footnotes, and more.</p>\n<p>Markdown editing needs to be manually activated from Jetpack’s settings, and LaTeX can be separately enabled for writing mathematical equations and formulas. You can then create and edit posts in Markdown using either the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/markdown/\">Block Editor</a> or <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/markdown-classic-editor/\">Classic Editor</a>. Unfortunately, neither syntax highlighting nor a Markdown preview pane are offered.</p>\n<p>If you use the block editor, a new Markdown block will become available. If you use the classic editor, you’ll get the best results in the text editor. The visual editor can produce unexpected results.</p>\n<p>The Markdown version of your post is retained for future editing, and the published post is saved in HTML automatically, so that your site will still look good even if the plugin is deactivated. Markdown comments are also supported.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1625894637markdownwp-jetpackblockeditor.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Jetpack\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"3wpeditormd\">3. WP Editor.md</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-editormd/\">WP Editor.md</a> is a WordPress Markdown editor with syntax highlighting and a preview pane. Unfortunately, very little documentation is available for it. It resembles WP Githuber MD’s interface and uses the Markdown module from Jetpack for parsing and saving content. When I tested the plugin, lists in the preview pane appeared double-spaced but looked fine when published.</p>\n<p>However, when it converts your posts to HTML it seems to save in that format. This frustrated one user who had been using Jetpack previously.

We&#8217;ll cover how to configure Django SMTP connections, how to set up an app password to use with a Django project, and how to send emails through the Django shell. We&#8217;ll also look at how to set up a contact form for collecting customer emails.</strong></p>\n<p>Most web applications use email to manage crucial operations, such as resetting passwords, account activation, receiving customer feedback, sending newsletters and marketing campaigns. Most of these tasks require a dedicated service like <a href=\"https://sendgrid.com/\">SendGrid</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mailgun.com/\">Mailgun</a>. But if you don&#8217;t expect your site to get a huge quantity of visitors, you can actually get a lot done through your personal email provider.</p>\n<p>Sending emails with your personal email is a reasonable option for small or testing projects, so we&#8217;ll take that approach here to keep things simple. However, it&#8217;s not a good idea to use your personal email service for your production website. You can learn more about <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852\">Gmail sending restrictions</a>, or refer to the limitations of your email provider.</p>\n<p><em>Note: the full code for this tutorial is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/Email-Django-app\">GitHub</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"understandingsmtp\">Understanding SMTP</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol\">SMTP</a> (or the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules for determining how emails are transferred from senders to recipients. SMTP servers use this protocol to send and relay outgoing emails. (Note that other protocols govern how emails are <em>recieved</em>.)</p>\n<p>An SMTP server always has a unique address, and a specific port for sending messages, which in most cases is <strong>587</strong>. We&#8217;ll see how the port is relevant while sending emails with Django.</p>\n<p>Since we&#8217;ll be using Gmail, the address we&#8217;ll be working with is <code>smtp.gmail.com</code>, and the port will be 587.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s see how we can send emails with Django.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingadjangoproject\">Creating a Django Project</h2>\n<p>Every Django project should have a virtual environment, as we don&#8217;t want to mess up the project dependencies. To create one, run the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">python -m venv .venv\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with virtual environments, make sure to check our <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/virtual-environments-python-made-easy/\">Python virtual environments guide</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The command above creates a virtual environment with the name <code>.venv</code>. To activate this virtual environment, you can use the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">source .venv/bin/activate\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since Django is a third-party package, you have to install it with pip:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">pip install django\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will install the latest version of Django, which you can check with <code>pip freeze</code>.</p>\n<p>To create a Django project, you call the command line utility <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/\">django-admin</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">django-admin startproject EmailProject\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the command above, you&#8217;re creating a Django project with the name <code>EmailProject</code>, but you can create the project with whatever name you want.</p>\n<p>Now, enter to the project directory and run the server:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd EmailProject\r\npython manage.py runserver\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>After running the Django server, visit <a href=\"http://localhost:8000\">http://localhost:8000</a> in your browser. You&#8217;ll see an auto-generated page with the latest Django release notes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1622419490django-screen.png\" alt=\"Django local server\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"modifyingsettings\">Modifying Settings</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to modify the settings file before sending emails, so let&#8217;s locate that file with the command <code>tree</code>:</p>\n<p><em>Note: for simplicity&#8217;s sake, we&#8217;ll be using only UNIX (macOS or Linux) system commands.</em></p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">tree\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>tree</code> command outputs the file structure of a directory. In this case, since we&#8217;re not giving it a specific directory path, we&#8217;ll get something similar to the following if we&#8217;re in the root folder of the project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">├── EmailProject\r\n│   ├── asgi.py\r\n│   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   ├── settings.py\r\n│   ├── urls.py\r\n│   └── wsgi.py\r\n└── manage.py\r\n\r\n1 directory, 6 files\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The file we&#8217;ll be constantly modifying through this tutorial is the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/\">settings.py</a> inside the <code>EmailProject</code> folder.</p>\n<p><code>settings.py</code> holds all the project configuration you&#8217;ll need, and allows you to set custom variables. As the Django docs say, &#8220;A settings file is just a Python module with module-level variables&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at the settings required for sending an email with Django. Open the <code>EmailProject/settings.py</code> file and paste the following settings at the bottom of the file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\"># EmailProject/settings.py\r\n\r\n# Bottom of the file\r\nEMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'\r\nEMAIL_HOST = ''\r\nEMAIL_PORT = 587\r\nEMAIL_USE_TLS = True\r\nEMAIL_HOST_USER = ''\r\nEMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let&#8217;s break down the code above by analyzing each one of these settings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emailbackend\">Email Backend</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#email-backend\">EMAIL_BACKEND</a> setting declares the backend our Django project will use to connect with the SMTP server.</p>\n<p>This variable is pointing to the <code>smtp.EmailBackend</code> class that receives all the parameters needed to send an email. I strongly suggest you take a look at the class constructor directly on the <a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/blob/8a7ac78b706797a03d26b88eddb9d1067ed35b66/django/core/mail/backends/smtp.py#L12\">Django source code</a>. You&#8217;ll be surprised by how readable this code is.</p>\n<p><em>Note: although this class is the default <code>EMAIL_BACKEND</code>, it&#8217;s considered a good practice to be explicit in the Django settings.</em></p>\n<p>All the other email settings will be based on the constructor of this <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/email/#smtp-backend\">EmailBackend class</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emailhost\">Email host</h3>\n<p>The <code>EMAIL_HOST</code> setting refers to the SMTP server domain you&#8217;ll be using. This depends on your email provider. Below is a table with the SMTP server host corresponding to three common providers:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Email provider</th>\n<th>SMTP server host</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Gmail</td>\n<td>smtp.gmail.com</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Outlook/Hotmail</td>\n<td>smtp-mail.outlook.com</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Yahoo</td>\n<td>smtp.mail.yahoo.com</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We&#8217;re leaving this setting blank for now since we&#8217;ll use a <code>.env</code> file later to avoid hard-coded sensitive keys or per-site configurations. You should never set credentials directly into code.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be using <a href=\"#usingdjangoenvirontohidesensitivekeys\">Django Environ</a> to solve this problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emailport\">Email Port</h3>\n<p>The <code>EMAIL_PORT</code> setting must be set to <code>587</code> because it&#8217;s the default port for most SMTP servers. This remains true for personal email providers.</p>\n<p>This port is used along with TLS encryption to ensure the security of email sending.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emailusetls\">Email Use TLS</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security\">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS) is a security protocol used across the Web to encrypt the communication between web apps (Django) and servers (SMTP server).</p>\n<p>Originally, we set the <code>EMAIL_USE_TLS</code> variable to <code>True</code>. This means Django will use Transport Layer Security to connect to the SMTP server and send emails. (It&#8217;s mandatory for personal email providers.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"emailhostuser\">Email Host User</h3>\n<p>The <code>EMAIL_HOST_USER</code> setting is your personal email address. Leave it blank for now, since we&#8217;ll use <code>django-environ</code> to set up all of these credentials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emailhostpassword\">Email Host Password</h3>\n<p>The <code>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD</code> setting is the app password you&#8217;ll get from your email account — the process we&#8217;ll be doing right after this section.</p>\n<p>Same story: leave this setting blank, as we&#8217;ll use environmental variables later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setupanapppasswordingmail\">Set Up an App Password in Gmail</h2>\n<p>To use the <code>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD</code> setting you&#8217;ll need to activate the <strong>less secure app access</strong> and have an app password from your personal email address.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t activate the <strong>less secure app access</strong>, you&#8217;ll probably get a <code>SMTPAuthenticationError</code>, because Django has no way to comply with Google security protocols.</p>\n<p>You may opt to use your normal password, but it would be even <em>more risky</em> than using an app password. My advice is to create a new Gmail account or to use a &#8220;testing&#8221; email address.</p>\n<p>Taking this into account, you can get a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en\">Gmail app password</a> with the steps below. Note that if you&#8217;re using an existing account and have enabled 2-step verification, you can skip steps 2 and 3:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create or Login into a Gmail account</li>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps\">myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps</a> and turn on the less secure apps option.<br />\n<img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1624766037turning-on-less-secure-app-access.png\" alt=\"Less secure apps\" /></li>\n<li>Enable <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification/enroll-welcome\">two-factor authentication</a>, as it&#8217;s required to get an app password.<br />\n<img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16247660342-factor-gmail.png\" alt=\"2-factor-verification\" /></li>\n<li>Now you have two-factor authentication enabled, it&#8217;s time to get an app password. You can do this by going to the <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/security\">security section</a> of your google account, scrolling down to the Signing in to Google section, and clicking on <strong>App passwords</strong>.<br />\n<img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1624766032less-secure-app.png\" alt=\"App password\" /></li>\n</ol>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to re-prompt your password (account password), before being redirected to the App passwords page. </p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re in, click on <strong>select app</strong>, where you&#8217;ll choose a custom name for that app password — such as &#8220;Django Send Email&#8221; — then click on <strong>GENERATE</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1624769990app-password-generate.png\" alt=\"App password generation\" /></p>\n<p>A new window will show up with a sixteen-character password. Copy it, because we&#8217;ll need it to configure our Django project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1624769988generated-password.png\" alt=\"Generated app password\" /></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using other email providers, make sure to read the following guides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.yahoo.com/kb/generate-separate-password-sln15241.html\">Yahoo app password</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-app-passwords\">Outlook or Hotmail app password</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"usingdjangoenvirontohidesensitivekeys\">Using Django Environ to Hide Sensitive Keys</h2>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re just sending emails in development, you shouldn&#8217;t write passwords directly into source code. This becomes even more important when using a <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/\">version control system</a> along with GitHub to host your project. <em>You don&#8217;t want people to access your data.</em></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how we can prevent this by using <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/django-environ/\">Django-environ</a>.</p>\n<p>Create a <code>.env</code> file inside the <code>EmailProject</code> directory (where the <code>settings.py</code> file is located) with the command below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd EmailProject/\r\nls\r\n\r\nsettings.py # The settings file must be here\r\n\r\ntouch .env\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, open that <code>.env</code> file and enter the following key–value pairs:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com\r\nEMAIL_HOST_USER=YourEmail@address\r\nEMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=YourAppPassword\r\nRECIPIENT_ADDRESS=TheRecieverOfTheMails\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Breaking down the contents of this file:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>EMAIL_HOST</code>: your email provider SMTP server address. See the email host table above for quick guidance. In this case, I&#8217;m using <code>smtp.gmail.com</code>, the Gmail SMTP address.</li>\n<li><code>EMAIL_HOST_USER</code>: your email address.</li>\n<li><code>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD</code>: the app password you just generated. Have in mind it doesn&#8217;t include any spaces.</li>\n<li><code>RECIPIENT_ADDRESS</code>: the email address in which you&#8217;ll receive the messages. This is a custom setting that we&#8217;ll create later to send all the emails to the same recipient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make use of these environmental variables, we&#8217;ll need to install <code>Django-environ</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">pip install django-environ\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: make sure your virtual environment is activated.</em></p>\n<p>Now, open the <code>settings.py</code> located at the <code>EmailProject</code> directory and use the code below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\"># EmailProject/settings.py\r\n# This should be at the start of the file\r\nimport environ\r\n\r\nenv = environ.Env()\r\nenviron.Env.read_env()\r\n\r\n# Previous settings ...\r\nEMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'\r\nEMAIL_HOST = env('EMAIL_HOST')\r\nEMAIL_PORT = 587\r\nEMAIL_USE_TLS = True\r\nEMAIL_HOST_USER = env('EMAIL_HOST_USER')\r\nEMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = env('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD')\r\n\r\n# Custom setting. To email\r\nRECIPIENT_ADDRESS = env('RECIPIENT_ADDRESS')\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>First, we&#8217;re importing the <code>environ</code> package at the top of the settings file. Remember that all imports should be at the start.</p>\n<p>Then we create an <code>env</code> variable which will contain all the key–value pairs available on the <code>.env</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>env('KEY')</code> statement means we&#8217;re looking up the value of that key. Make sure you have set up your <code>.env</code> file before proceeding, because you&#8217;ll get a  Django <code>ImproperlyConfigured</code> error in case some environmental variable wasn&#8217;t set.</p>\n<p>Note that <code>RECIPIENT_ADDRESS</code> is a custom setting that we&#8217;ll use to send the emails to an address we can access.</p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget</strong> to include the <code>.env</code> file in your <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore\">.gitignore</a> in case you&#8217;re using Git and GitHub. You can do this just by opening it and adding the following line:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"git language-git\">.env\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/django-send-email/?utm_source=rss\">How to Send Email with Django</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

            "<p>When we talk about boosting productivity in application management, we are talking about the ability to produce greater output with the same amount of input to reduce human labor, capital, and development time. </p>\n\n<p>Strapi is a tool that can be used in boosting productivity in any application.<br>\nBoosting productivity helps meet the primary goals of the application. It will encourage each team member to improve their skills, and also it will help in rendering better services to the application users in an effective way. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Strapi</strong>? <br>\nStrapi is an open-source Node.js headless CMS based on Nodejs to build fast, dynamic, and easily manageable APIs written in JavaScript. strapi makes it easier to build applications using jamstack technology, which separates the backend from the frontend and enables dynamic applications.</p>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#the-benefit-of-effective-productivity\">\n  </a>\n  The benefit of effective productivity\n</h2>\n\n<p>There are many benefits of boosting productivity which vary from one application to another. Here are some of the major benefits of effective productivity of using strapi:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enhanced team relationship</strong> - effective productivity enables good communication between each team member as they work together to offer the best services. Each team will deliberate on improving the application and how they can work together to achieve their common goals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Setting and meeting goals</strong> - it helps set and meet the application goals, In the sense that each member of the team knows how they can improve the application on their own using appropriate tools and work to achieve these common goals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enhance better concentration</strong> - it enables team members to focus on their part without depending on one another. While the backend team is working, the frontend team can be working on their part simultaneously. This enables each team member to be productive on their part. </p>\n\n<p><strong>It saves development time</strong> - application build using jamstack technology always saves application development time. It allows the backend team to work on the application while the frontend team is working on the same application simultaneously without negatively affecting the application.</p>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#strapi-installation-prerequisite\">\n  </a>\n  Strapi installation prerequisite\n</h2>\n\n<p>Before installing strapi, the following software should have the following application installed on your computer:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Npm</li>\n<li>Node.js</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#installation-of-strapi\">\n  </a>\n  Installation of strapi\n</h2>\n\n<p>Installing the Strap is pretty straightforward. Use the following cmd code to create a new strapi project:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>    npx create-strapi-app applicationname <span class=\"nt\">--quickstart</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that the folder to install the strapi is empty.</p>\n\n<p>This will install all the needed packages for this project. After the installation, our Strapi app will automatically be launched in our browser, then register for super admin users to manage the database.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#strapi-increases-productivity\">\n  </a>\n  Strapi increases productivity\n</h2>\n\n<p>Strapi is used to increase application productivity because it has all the tools required to boost application productivity. Because of these tools, many applications are built using strapi.</p>\n\n<p>Strapi increase productivity through the following ways:</p>\n\n<p><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>: <br>\nStrapi has a very good user interface that enables the admin user to navigate and manage their resources and other team members. These features make it easy to learn how to interact with the Interface and make it simple to manage any team member.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: <br>\nStrapi makes the applications scalable in the sense that whenever the frontend is having performance issues, it does not affect the backend because they are separated using jamstack technology. </p>\n\n<p>This helps increase productivity in the applications because the backend team does not have to wait for the frontend team to resolve the issue before working on their side. strapi enable independent components.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plugin:</strong> <br>\nStrapi enables the admin to install any plugin needed for effective management of the application. A plugin can be installed from the strapi marketplace. Examples of plugins are content manager, content type builder, media library, international plugin e.t.c. All these plugins help to boost productivity in one way or the other.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jamstack technology:</strong> <br>\nStrapi supports jamstack, which allows the frontend team to share content with the backend team via a RESTFUL API call. This allows dynamic delivery of content across many platforms. This helps boost productivity because it allows the application to load faster and makes SEO optimization very effective.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#content-creators-focus-on-content\">\n  </a>\n  <strong>Content creators focus on content</strong>.\n</h2>\n\n<p>Strapi allows different users with specific roles and permission on the dashboard. This helps to determine what type of actions each team member can perform on the dashboard.</p>\n\n<p>A team member with the <strong>author's</strong> role will only be permitted to post content into the application, which will need the approval of the <strong>Editor</strong> user or <strong>Super-admin</strong> user after the review of the content. In contrast, a team member with an Editor role can create content without the super-admin user's approval and manage the content of the <strong>author</strong> group.</p>\n\n<p>Strapi enables different team members to work on the application simultaneously without affecting the system. Content creators only have to focus on creating good, dynamic content and how to optimize this content effectively using the available tools provided by strapi in the dashboard.</p>\n\n<p>These tools include the following:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Target users:</strong> it helps to deliver different content for different users in different areas. This enables you to render content for your users in their local language by translating them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Content modeling</strong> allows you to document all types of content that you'll need now and in the future to ensure it is effectively configured for multiple channels.<br>\nIt's possible to serve your user the content that they are looking for whenever they need it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The editor interface</strong> enables restricted content access and automates workflows with webhooks to communicate with your team when content has been changed and is ready for editor review. With the editor interface creating content is made easy by strapi. It allows a content creator to add a description to content.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#devs-focus-on-dev-work\">\n  </a>\n  Devs focus on dev work\n</h2>\n\n<p>With strapi used as a backend, developers only have to focus on the frontend because strapi is easy to set up, manage and connect to the frontend using jamstack technology. </p>\n\n<p>Developers do not have to worry about the security of the content. Strapi has them back up. The content exchange between strapi (backend) and the frontend is done via a RESTFUL API call, and these API calls have many functions that developers can use to suit their own needs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multi-Medium Sharing:</strong> Strapi allows developers to share content across different mediums. The same content can be shared with web applications, mobile applications, desktop applications simultaneously. This helps developers to focus on the content that will be displayed on each of the mediums used.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cross-Platform Technology:</strong> Strapi allows developers to use any programming language for their application as long as the language supports RESTFUL API. This tool is very useful because it enables different developers to work on one application using different programming languages. The have to do to get content is to make a RESTFUL API call to strap endpoint.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#conclusion\">\n  </a>\n  Conclusion\n</h2>\n\n<p>In this article, we discussed boosting production with strapi, installing strapi as a tool for boosting productivity, the benefit of boosting productivity, and most importantly, looking at how strapi boosts productivity because of developers, tools, and content creators.</p>\n\n<p>Strapi is easy to learn and use. If you are looking for the best Headless CMS for your application to boost productivity and work with your team, you can get started with strapi checking their documentation page.</p>\n\n"

It lets a social team schedule posts ahead of time, engage with prospects, and streamline results all in one place.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634689770social-media-automation-tool.jpg\" alt=\"Social posts automation tool\" /></p>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/developer-laptop-computer-with-open-robotic-soft-open-automation-architecture-open-source-robotics-soft-free-development-concept_11667733.htm\">Source</a></small></p>\n<h3 id=\"schedulingcontentisntaboutlosingcontrol\">Scheduling content isn&#8217;t about losing control</h3>\n<p>Having social media automation doesn&#8217;t mean letting AI, chatbots, and automation tools take over your social media accounts.</p>\n<p>Social media automation tools are meant to help you manage your social accounts efficiently. They can uncover ways to widen your social networks, monitor brand mentions, and offer content ideas. However, you&#8217;ll still need the human touch when it comes to writing posts, communicating with your audience, and interpreting results from analytical tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tipsforsocialmediaautomation\">Tips for Social Media Automation</h2>\n<p>Social media automation enables brands to save time and build an active online presence on social media networks. To maximize its potential, let&#8217;s take a look at some of the best practices you should follow.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id=\"1setgoalsforsocialmediaautomation\">1. Set goals for social media automation</h3>\n<p>When you&#8217;re starting out, you don&#8217;t have to purchase multiple automation tools in an instant and automate everything.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Start by identifying your social media goals. What do you want to achieve? And what should you automate in the process?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are some goals to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>posting social content consistently</li>\n<li>responding immediately to customer support requests</li>\n<li>speeding up content curation</li>\n<li>improving the efficiency of social media marketers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can set any goal you want. However, your objective will determine the type of social media automation tools you get first.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to improve customer service, then integrate chatbots into your social media pages. Alternatively, teams that want to focus on consistency may find that a social media scheduler is an absolute game changer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2beawareoftimezonesforsocialmediamarketing\">2. Be aware of time zones for social media marketing</h3>\n<p>Social media lets brands engage with consumers from across the globe.</p>\n<p>So, where are your consumers located? What time zones are they in? Knowing the best time to post based on your target audience&#8217;s location will help you get more eyeballs for your content.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634689936social-media-timezone.jpg\" alt=\"social media posts time zone\" /></p>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/london-new-york-tokyo-and-moscow-clocks-48770/\">Source</a></small></p>\n<p>The social media algorithm favors posts that rack up a lot of engagement immediately after they&#8217;ve posted. Because they get more likes and shares, they&#8217;re perceived to be relevant content. Thus, this increases the likelihood that more people will see your post on their feed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all approach for posting times.&nbsp;Results may vary depending on your industry and the social media habits of consumers in a specific location or country. As an experiment, try to post at different times and see which times generate the most impressions, before committing to a specific pattern.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id=\"3automatesocialmediaposts\">3. Automate social media posts</h3>\n<p>Posting frequency matters a lot in social media. If you don&#8217;t post often, followers will easily forget your brand. But if you post too frequently, followers may be bombarded with too many marketing messages on their feed. So, how do you find the sweet spot?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For most social media platforms, it&#8217;s best to consistently maintain the rate of your posts. As long as your engagement rate is consistent, you&#8217;ll be able to grow your audience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A good tip is to build a social media calendar with a posting schedule for every piece of content you plan to publish. The calendar serves as a visual representation of your posting frequency. That way, you can ensure that your marketing efforts are consistent for every platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634690354social-media-calendar.jpg\" alt=\"Social media posts calendar for scheduling content\" /></p>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/creative-hand-drawn-social-media-calendar-template_15629077.htm\">Source</a></small></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no need to create a social media calendar from scratch. Social media automation tools let marketers schedule posts at a specific time. This can save you from the tedious process of posting content across different platforms, especially for ambitious social media marketing campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id=\"4usesociallisteningtools\">4. Use social listening tools</h3>\n<p>Social listening lets marketers know what people say about their brand on social platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A social listening tool lets marketers monitor brand mentions from multiple sources all in one place. On top of that, you can follow a specific topic, hashtag, or keyword to uncover valuable insights about your small business or your competitors. What&#8217;s new in your industry? Why are your competitors getting more social media engagement? </p>\n<p>Using social listening tools will help uncover gaps in your strategy and even spark content ideas for your upcoming campaigns.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/social-media-automation-getting-started/?utm_source=rss\">How to Get Started with Social Media Automation</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

If the browser window is 480 pixels wide, for example, we might shift our navigation from a horizontal one to a vertical, collapsible list. We can do something similar when using SVG with media queries.</strong></p>\n<p>This article is an extract from Tiffany&#8217;s book <em><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/css-master-3rd-edition\">CSS Master, 3rd Edition</a></em>. Check it out if you&#8217;d like to master other advanced CSS3 features like Flexbox and Grid!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>\n<p>As well as using CSS with HTML, we can also use CSS with SVG, or <em>Scalable Vector Graphics</em>. SVG is a markup format for describing flat, two-dimensional images. Because it’s a markup language, it has a Document Object Model, and can be used with CSS.</p>\n<p>By using CSS with SVG, we can change the appearance of SVG based on user interaction. Or we can use the same SVG document in multiple places, and show or hide portions of it based on the width of the viewport.</p>\n<p>All major browser engines support the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=svg\">SVG 1.1</a> specification, and they have done for years. Support for features of <a href=\"https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/\">SVG 2</a>, on the other hand, is still a work in progress. Some of what we’ll discuss here has limited browser support at the time of writing. That may have changed by the time you’re reading this. Keep an eye on the Chromium meta issue — <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=225863\">Implement SVG2 features</a> — to track development progress in Chromium-based browsers. Watch the <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1328534\">Support SVG 2 features</a> meta issue to follow Firefox’s implementation work, and WebKit’s <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191292\">Implement SVG 2</a> meta issue for Safari. Issue trackers can be unpleasant to navigate, but for now they’re the best way to track SVG 2 support.</p>\n<p>Before we go any further, however, let’s talk about what SVG is and why you should use it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vectorimagesversusrasterimages\">Vector Images versus Raster Images</h2>\n<p>Most of the images currently used on the Web are raster images, also known as bitmap images. <strong>Raster images</strong> are made up of pixels on a fixed grid, with a set number of pixels per inch. JPEG, WebP, GIF, and PNG are all examples of raster image formats.</p>\n<p>Raster images are <em>resolution dependent</em>. A 144 PPI (pixels-per-inch) PNG image looks great on a device with a 144 PPI display resolution. When viewed on a higher resolution, 400 PPI display, however, that same image can look fuzzy. Raster images also have fixed dimensions and look best at their original size. Scaling a 150 by 150 pixel image up to 300 by 300 pixels distorts it.</p>\n<p>Instead of using pixels on a grid, vector image formats describe the primitive shapes — circles, rectangles, lines, or paths — that make up an image, and their placement within the document’s coordinate system. As a result, vector images are <em>resolution independent</em>, and retain their quality regardless of display resolution or display dimensions.</p>\n<p>Resolution independence is the biggest advantage of SVG. We can scale images up or down with no loss of quality. The same image looks great on both high and low PPI devices. That said, SVG is poorly suited to the amount of color data required for photographs. It’s best for drawings and shapes. Use it in place of PNG and GIF images, and as a more flexible replacement for icon fonts.</p>\n<p>Another advantage of SVG is that it was designed to be used with other web languages. We can create, modify, and manipulate SVG images with JavaScript. Or, as we’ll see below, we can style and animate SVG using CSS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"associatingcsswithsvgdocuments\">Associating CSS with SVG Documents</h2>\n<p>Using CSS with SVG is a lot like using it with HTML. We can apply CSS using the <code>style</code> attribute of an SVG element, group CSS within a document using the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element, or link to an external stylesheet. The pros and cons of each method are the same as when using CSS with HTML.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usingthestyleattribute\">Using the <code>style</code> Attribute</h3>\n<p>Here’s a simple SVG document where the code creates a black circle:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"svg language-svg\">&lt;svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 200 200\" \r\n➥enable-background=\"new 0 0 200 200\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;circle cx=\"101.3\" cy=\"96.8\" r=\"79.6\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/svg&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The image below shows how that code renders in a browser.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295140SVG1-1Circle.jpg\" alt=\"A circle in SVG\" width=\"400\" height=\"389\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-203142\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295140SVG1-1Circle.jpg 400w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295140SVG1-1Circle-300x292.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></p>\n<p>Let’s give our circle a pink fill using CSS and the <code>style</code> attribute:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"svg language-svg\">&lt;svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 200 200\" \r\n➥enable-background=\"new 0 0 200 200\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;circle cx=\"101.3\" cy=\"96.8\" r=\"79.6\" style=\"fill: #f9f\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/svg&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The effect of this is shown below.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295175SVG1-2Circle.jpg\" alt=\"Using the style attribute to add a fill color\" width=\"400\" height=\"384\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-203144\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295175SVG1-2Circle.jpg 400w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295175SVG1-2Circle-300x288.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></p>\n<p>Here’s one difference between using CSS with HTML and using it with SVG: property names. Many of the CSS properties that we use with HTML documents aren’t compatible with SVG, and vice versa. We’ll come back to this point later in the chapter.</p>\n<p>Using the <code>style</code> attribute isn’t the best way to use CSS, of course. Doing so limits the ability to reuse those styles across multiple elements or documents. Instead, we should use inline or linked CSS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"embeddingcssinsvgdocuments\">Embedding CSS in SVG Documents</h3>\n<p>Instead of using the <code>style</code> attribute, we can use the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"svg language-svg\">&lt;svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0\r\n➥ 200 200\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 200 200\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;style type=\"text/css\"&gt;\r\n        circle {\r\n            fill: #0c0;\r\n        }\r\n    &lt;/style&gt;\r\n    &lt;circle cx=\"101.3\" cy=\"96.8\" r=\"79.6\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/svg&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Embedding CSS in an SVG document lets us reuse those styles for multiple elements within the same document, but it prevents that CSS from being shared across multiple documents. That’s fine for logos and icons. But if you’re creating something like a library of chart styles, an external CSS file is a better bet.</p>\n<p>Using a standard text editor, you can also add CSS to SVG images created with software such as Sketch, Inkscape, or Illustrator. Doing so won’t affect your ability to edit the image with the drawing application, but if you edit the file using image software, the application may rewrite or remove your CSS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"linkingfromsvgtoanexternalcssfile\">Linking from SVG to an External CSS File</h3>\n<p>As with HTML, linking to an external CSS file makes it possible to share styles across several SVG documents. To link an external CSS file, add <code>&lt;? xml-stylesheet ?&gt;</code> to the beginning of your SVG file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"svg language-svg\">&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\r\n&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=\"style.css\" type=\"text/css\"?&gt;\r\n&lt;svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0\r\n➥ 200 200\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 200 200\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;circle cx=\"101.3\" cy=\"96.8\" r=\"79.6\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/svg&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"usingthelinkelement\">Using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> Element</h4>\n<p>Alternatively, use the HTML <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element. If you do use this method, you’ll need to include the <code>xmlns</code> namespace attribute, as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"svg language-svg\">&lt;link href=\"style.css\" type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"\r\n    ➥ xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" /&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: some older browsers need the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element to be enclosed by <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> tags.</em></p>\n<p>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element isn’t an SVG element. It belongs to HTML and XHTML. XHTML is a variant of HTML that’s parsed according to the rules of XML markup. According to the rules of XML, we can borrow elements and their behavior from other XML dialects, such as XHTML. To do so, however, we need to tell the browser which namespace the element belongs to using the <code>xmlns</code> attribute.</p>\n<h4 id=\"usingimport\">Using <code>@import</code></h4>\n<p>We can also link to an external stylesheet by using <code>@import</code> inside <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/style&gt;</code> tags:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;style type=\"text/css\"&gt;\r\n@import('style.css');\r\n&lt;/style&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This method functions similarly to the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> method.</p>\n<h4 id=\"svgandtheimgelementlimitations\">SVG and the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> Element: Limitations</h4>\n<p>Linking from SVG files to external assets, including CSS files, doesn’t work with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. This is a security limitation of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element that’s baked into browsers.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to use linked CSS with your SVG images, you’ll need to do either of these two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element in your SVG document to place your CSS inline</li>\n<li>use an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element (see note below)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: Craig Buckler’s tutorial “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/add-svg-to-web-page/\">How to Add Scalable Vector Graphics to Your Web Page</a>” discusses using <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> in detail.</em></p>\n<p>In general, you should use <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> over <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>. However, the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element can be the child of an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, while <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> can’t. Using <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> also makes the SVG document tree available to the parent document’s document tree. This means that we can use JavaScript to interact with it (for example, with <code>document.querySelector('iframe').contentDocument</code>). </p>\n<h4 id=\"inlinesvgandexternalassets\">Inline SVG and External Assets</h4>\n<p>When adding SVG to HTML, the browser won’t load external assets referenced by the SVG document. We can, however, link to CSS for our SVG document from the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of our HTML document:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;head&gt;\r\n    ⋮\r\n    &lt;link href=\"svg.css\" type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>SVG elements within HTML documents also become part of the HTML document tree. If you’re using inline SVG,  it’s perfectly fine to combine your HTML-related and SVG-related CSS in the same stylesheet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"differencesbetweensvgandhtml\">Differences between SVG and HTML</h2>\n<p>While SVG and HTML are both markup languages, there are two significant differences between them that affect how they work with CSS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SVG doesn’t adhere to the CSS box model</li>\n<li>SVG lacks a positioning scheme</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"svgdoesntadheretothecssboxmodel\">SVG Doesn’t Adhere to the CSS Box Model</h3>\n<p>When used with HTML, CSS layout follows the rules of the CSS box model. SVG, on the other hand, uses coordinates for layout. It adheres to what may be best understood as a “shape model”.</p>\n<p>SVG shapes aren’t limited to rectangular boxes. As a result, most box-model–related properties don’t apply to SVG elements. You can’t, for instance, change the <code>padding</code> or <code>margin</code> of an SVG element. Nor can you use the <code>box-sizing</code>, <code>box-shadow</code>, <code>outline</code>, or <code>border-*</code> properties. Grid layout, floats, and Flexbox also don’t work.</p>\n<p>You can, however, use CSS to set or change a range of SVG properties and attribute values. The full list is outlined in the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/propidx.html\">SVG 2</a> specification, although support in most browsers is incomplete. Some CSS properties, such as <code>filter</code>, can be used with SVG or HTML. We’ll discuss a few of them in this chapter, within the context of specific techniques.</p>\n<h3 id=\"svglacksapositioningscheme\">SVG Lacks a Positioning Scheme</h3>\n<p>When CSS is used with HTML, element boxes can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>exist within a normal flow</li>\n<li>be removed from normal flow with the <code>float</code> property</li>\n<li>be removed from normal flow with the <code>position</code> property</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The CSS specification refers to these as <em>positioning schemes</em>. Positioning schemes don’t exist in SVG. The <code>position</code> property has no effect on SVG elements. Neither do properties such as <code>top</code>, <code>left</code> and <code>bottom</code>, which depend on elements being positioned. You also can’t float elements within an SVG document.</p>\n<p>Instead, SVG uses a coordinate system for element placement. To create a <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code>, for example, you need to set its center point coordinates using the <code>cx</code> and <code>cy</code> attributes, and set a radius length using the <code>r</code> attribute. A polygon consists of a series of point coordinates and line segments drawn between them. In other words, you can define where an element will be drawn to the SVG canvas, but you can’t “position” them in the CSS sense of the word.</p>\n<p>Related to positioning schemes, SVG also lacks the idea of <code>z-index</code> and stacking contexts.</p>\n<p><em>Note: the <a href=\"https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/\">SVG 2</a> specification does define behavior for <code>z-index</code> and stacking contexts in SVG documents, but most browsers don’t yet support it.</em></p>\n<p>SVG elements are instead stacked according to their source order. Those that appear later in the document sit towards the top of the stack. If you want to change the stacking order of SVG elements, you’ll need to move them around in the source or use JavaScript to reorder them in the DOM tree.</p>\n<p>In fact, most CSS 2.1 properties don’t apply to SVG documents. Exceptions include animations and transforms, <code>display</code>, <code>overflow</code>, <code>visibility</code>, <code>filter</code>, and a few font and text-related properties. Instead, you’ll have to use <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/propidx.html\">SVG-specific styling properties with SVG documents</a>. Most of these properties can also be expressed as SVG element attributes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stylingsvgelements\">Styling SVG Elements</h2>\n<p>Here’s a simple example of how to style SVG elements using CSS. First our SVG document, which is a stand-alone file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"svg language-svg\">&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\r\n&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=\"styles.css\" type=\"text/css\" ?&gt;\r\n&lt;svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\r\n➥\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" viewBox=\"0 0 497\r\n➥ 184\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 497 184\" xml:space=\"preserve\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;polygon id=\"star\" points=\"77,23.7 98.2,66.6 145.5,66.5 111.2,\r\n➥106.9,119.3,154 77,131.8 34.7,154 42.8,106.9 8.5,67.5 55.8,\r\n➥66.6 \"/&gt;\r\n    &lt;circle id=\"circle\" cx=\"245\" cy=\"88.9\" r=\"67.5\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;/svg&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This markup creates the image shown below.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295220SVGCircleStar.jpg\" alt=\"A simple circle and star SVG image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"478\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-203146\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295220SVGCircleStar.jpg 1000w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295220SVGCircleStar-300x143.jpg 300w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295220SVGCircleStar-768x367.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Although we can’t use most CSS properties with SVG documents, we can use CSS to change an element’s color. Let’s make our star yellow:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">#star {\r\n    fill: hsl( 44, 100%, 50% );\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll often see the <code>fill</code> attribute used with SVG tags — for example, <code>&lt;circle fill=\"rgb( 255, 185, 0 )\" cx=\"3\" cy=\"10\" r=\"100\"&gt;</code> — but it’s also a property that can be used with CSS.</p>\n<p>We can also use CSS to adjust an element’s <code>stroke</code>, which is the outline of an SVG shape. A shape’s stroke exists, even if no <code>stroke</code> properties are set. Let’s give our circle a dark blue, dashed border that’s ten pixels wide. We’ll also set its <code>fill</code> property to <code>cornflowerblue</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">circle {\r\n    fill: cornflowerblue;\r\n    stroke: darkblue;\r\n    stroke-width: 10;\r\n    stroke-dasharray: 10, 15;\r\n    stroke-linecap: round;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Together this gives us the result below.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295270SVGCircleStar2.jpg\" alt=\"A simple circle and star SVG image\" width=\"1000\" height=\"507\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-203148\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295270SVGCircleStar2.jpg 1000w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295270SVGCircleStar2-300x152.jpg 300w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1630295270SVGCircleStar2-768x389.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/using-svg-with-media-queries/?utm_source=rss\">Using SVG with Media Queries</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

So we know he’s still an expert in Vanilla JS, but did you know he’s solely responsible for New Zealand being missing from 50% of world maps? My smashing friends, please welcome back, Chris Ferdinandi. Hi Chris, how are you?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris Ferdinandi:</span> Oh, I’m smashing. Thanks for having me Drew. Interesting thing. I actually make sure New Zealand is not on maps because it’s probably my favorite country in the whole world and I don’t want too many people to know about it.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> You want it to remain unspoiled.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Indeed.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> So welcome back to the podcast. Last time we talked, we posed this question of if modern best practices, the use of reactive frameworks and these sorts of things were actually bad for the progress of the web. And I don’t know whether it was a controversial episode or it just struck a chord with a lot of listeners, but that conversation has been one of the most shared and listened to episodes that we’ve put out that smashing.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Oh, that’s awesome.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> It’s actually been more than a year now, 15 months since we recorded that, which at the pace the web moves is like literally forever. So I wanted to ask, has anything changed? Is the web still in a terminal decline? Has the needle shifted at all?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah, quite a bit has changed quite a bit has not. So I think, it’s so weird. The web technology changes so fast, but the web itself tends to move a little bit slower just in terms of developer trends and habits. And so you see these slightly longer arcs where you’ll have a bunch of technology pile up around one approach and then it’ll slowly start to swing the other way and then change all at once. And so last time we talked, I think one of the big kind of&hellip; Well, I had two big points related to the modern web. The first was, we’re using a lot of tools that give developers convenience, but we’re using those tools at the expense of the user. So we’re throwing a ton of client-side JS at people, and that introduces a ton of agility and performance issues.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> The other big point that I was really hammering on was that these tools don’t necessarily improve the developer experience as much as I think people think they do. They do for some people. And I think for another segment of the front end professionals it actually can make things a little bit worse. But what I’m starting to see happen now, and one of the things I’d love to dig into a little bit more is I think we’re seeing a new, it’s almost like a second generation of tools that take a lot of the developer benefits that these client-side frameworks bring and strip away the punishing effects that we put on our users as a result. So it’s taking those same concepts and tools and packaging them a little bit differently in a way that’s actually better for the front end.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> So one of the things I’ve been talking about with people lately is this idea that modern development has broken the web, but it’s also starting to fix it. And so we can definitely dig into that in a bunch of different angles, depending on where you want to take this conversation.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> Sure. What sort of things have you seen in the last year that really stand out from that point of view?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah, so the two biggest trends I’ve noticed are the rise of microframeworks. So where we saw a lot of really big all encompassing libraries for a while React, Vue before that angular, which is just a massive beast at this point, we’ve started to see smaller libraries that do the same thing come into their own. So for example, I think the king of this hill is probably Preact, which is a three kilobyte alternative to React that uses the same API, ships way less code and actually runs orders of magnitude faster on safe updates than React does too. So you’ve got things like that.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> For a while you had&hellip; Well, it’s still out there, but Alpine JS, which was inspired by VJS and then actually inspired Evan You who built Vue to release Petite Vue, which is a 5.5 kilobyte subset of Vue that’s optimized around progressive enhancement. So these are still client-side libraries, but the intent behind them is that they ship less code, include fewer abstractions and ultimately work faster and put less of that cost on the front end user. So that’s been one angle.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> And then the second trend I’ve seen that I think is personally more compelling is a shift from libraries to compilers. And so the one that kicked this whole trend off was felt by Rich Harris, which takes the idea of state based reactivity. But instead of having this be a thing that runs in real time in the client, you author your code with the same general pattern that you might with React or Vue, and then you run a build tool that compiles all that into plain old HTML and vanilla JavaScript, and that’s what gets shipped to the browser. And so you’ve stripped out almost all of the abstractions in the client and you deliver something that’s way closer to what you might hand write with old school DOM manipulation, but with the developer convenience of state based EI. So that was really interesting.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> More recently there’s a new tool called ASTRO that builds on what Rich did with Svelt, and also allows you to pull in components from your favorite libraries so you can mix and match Vue, React, FELT, Vanilla, JavaScript, all in one package, compile it all out into Vanilla JavaScript and ship orders of magnitude, less code without the abstractions. And so it would run way faster in the browser as well. And those are, I think for me, really the two big things that are like standing on the shoulders of giants and producing a front end that will hopefully start to be a little bit faster. The compilers in particular are interesting because they take us away from rendering HTML in the browser as much as possible. You still render your HTML or you still author it with JavaScript if you want, but the outputted result is more static HTML and less JavaScript, which is always a good thing.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> Do you think this is the ecosystem’s response to this quiet developer dissatisfaction about the weight of modern frameworks? Is it just a natural heave and ho?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah, it is. Although to be honest, I’m not entirely sure how much of this was driven by&hellip; Well, there’s some definitely some performance minded developers out there who have been very vocal about how these tools are bad for the user. I don’t know that that’s necessarily representative of the general population though. I mean, certainly a subset of it given how the last time we talked that episode did, but I think one of the things that none of these tools for me get at is&hellip; Or the thing that I’m most bothered by by the modern web that I don’t think these tools address is that I personally feel like just the development process in general is over complicated.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> This is where I get into the whole like, I don’t think the developer experience is actually better with these tools, but I think for a lot of developers in maybe a team environment, it can be. For me as a largely solo developer, I find these tools more trouble than they’re worth, but I know a lot of folks disagree with me there, so I don’t want to dismiss that as invalid. If you find these tools useful great, but yeah, I think this is maybe a natural pendulum swing back in the other direction.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> The third thing that I didn’t talk about that your question actually makes me think about though is, there is almost a natural cycle in the web where you start to throw a lot of JavaScript at solving problems as the web and the capabilities of it grow. And eventually those JavaScript libraries get absorbed by the platform itself, but it’s a much slower process than creating a new JavaScript library is, because it’s standard processes and how important those are. So we saw the same thing happen with jQuery, right, where the amount of JavaScript being used on the web swelled with jQuery and jQuery plugins.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> And then eventually the web platform realized that these ways of doing things are really smart and we started to get native ways to do it. And then there was this really long, slow petering off of the shift away from jQuery. So I think these libraries, as much as they’ve done a lot of&hellip; That’ll be a little controversial here and say, they’ve done a lot of damage to the web. They’ve also served an important function in paving cow path for what native APIs could look like it could do. So I don’t want to completely dismiss them as terrible.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> It’s interesting that you mentioned ASTRO just a little bit earlier. I’ve actually recorded an interview with Matthew Phillips. I’m not sure if it goes out before or after this one. He’s one of the core developers on ASTRO. And it certainly is a very creative and an interesting approach to the problem. I do wonder as you saying how much this is. We’ve created a set of problems for ourselves and so now we’ve created a new solution, which patches over those problems and gives us something even better. But are we just stacking the bricks on top of each other and still ending up with a very wobbly tower because of it? Are we just going down the wrong path?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> It depends. So I, as the hair on my head has started to disappear and my beard has gotten whiter, I’ve started to talk in fewer absolutes than I did. And so five years ago, I would’ve said, &ldquo;Absolutely yes.&rdquo; I don’t want to diminish the value of these tools in a team environment. And the other thing, I honestly think a lot of libraries really have the potential to at least patch fix in the interim is accessibility problems with the web around complex UI components. So in short, if I were to give this just a one sentence, yes, I do think in many ways we’re creating a really delicate house of cards that collapses very easily. And I think one of the nicest things about using mostly or almost entirely platform native to build for the web, so just authoring an HTML, CSS and JavaScript is, you cannot touch that code for five years and come back to it and you don’t have any dependencies to update. You don’t have any build tools to run, to start working with it again. It just works. And that’s really great.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> But I think the thing I see with libraries is a lot of them come into creation to fill gaps in what the platform can do. And what I’ve noticed happens is after the platform catches up, the libraries stick around for a really long time. And so the thing I always try to do is be a little bit deliberate about what I add to the things I build, because it’s really easy to add stuff and really hard to take it away once it’s there. And just, I think to ground these heady abstract concepts, I’m talking about for a sec, every year, web aim, Web Accessibility consultancy firm does a survey of the top million sites on the web. And they run an audit, just automated audits. They’re not doing a detailed inspection of all these sites. So just stuff that, simple like robot tasks and pickup. And historically, one of the things they’ve always found is that sites that use UI rendering libraries have more accessibility issues than sites that don’t.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> This year they found the same trend with one exception. Sites that use React actually have fewer accessibility issues than sites that don’t. And that is a notable trend or noticeable departure, rather from the year before when React sites had more accessibility issues.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> I noticed a lot of focus on accessibility in the React community over the last year, building more accessible components, accessible routing, things of that nature. And for complex components, things like tabs and disclosure widgets, and sliders and things like that, it is really hard to do those accessibly with just HTML and Vanilla JavaScript. Trying to keep track of which ARIA attributes you need to add on, which elements and how to change them based on different behaviors and how to shift focus and announce different things is really complex. And I think these libraries as much as they can be a very delicate house of cards, I see a huge potential there to fill these gaps. Where I’d ultimately love to end up though, is in a place where the platform, the web, browsers offer native components that do those things so that you don’t need the libraries. And I think the details and summary elements provide a really nice model for what that could look like.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> So if you’re listening to this and you don’t know what those are, the details element is an HTML element that you wrap around some content, and then inside it you nest a summary element with like a little description of what’s in that content. And by default, this element will be a collapsed bit of content. And when you click on the stuff in the summary, it expands and then when you click it again, it collapses and it shows a little arrow when it’s open or closed to indicate what’s happening here. It’s accessible out of the box. If the browser doesn’t support it, it shows all the content by default. So it’s just automatically progressively enhanced. You don’t need to do anything special there.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> It can be styled with CSS. You can even change what the icons that display when it’s expanded and collapsed are, just with CSS. You don’t need to write any JS for it, but if you wanted to extend the behavior in some way you can, because it also exposes a JavaScript event that fires whenever it’s toggled open or closed. And I would love to see more stuff like that for tabs, for image sliders or carousels or photo galleries, which just&hellip; We have so many different interactive components now on the web that may or may not always be appropriate, but they’re in the designs and people are building them and having a way to do those things where you didn’t have to fumble through how to make them accessible or lean on a 30 kilobyte library would be awesome.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> And so for me, that’s, I think, the next evolution of the web. That’s where I really want to see things start to go. And I think that’s the big need that these libraries address today in addition to some other stuff like changing the UI based on state changes and interesting use cases like that.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> Yeah. Modern browsers are just so capable now and they automatically update themselves and they include many of the features natively that we’ve previously relied on, on big frameworks and build tools for. Is the requirement of a build process to deploy a project a red flag in 2021? Should HTML and CSS and JS just be deployable as it is?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> So technically they are. I don’t think for most build processes that’s real or for most apps or sites or companies that’s necessarily realistic today. I don’t know that I’d call it a red flag as much as a resigned I wish it wasn’t like this, but I understand why it is, for me. Even for myself, my site has several thousand pages on it now. I think I’m up to three or four thousand pages and there’s no way I am just hand coding all those. I use a static site generator and I think tools like that can be really great.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> I think there’s some challenge there in that they become things that have to be kept updated and maintained. And so I like to keep mine as lean as possible, but I think build tools that put more of the run time on you, the developer, and thus allow you to ship less to the browser are a good thing, especially as the things we build become more complex. So I don’t know that I would necessarily say it’s just by default a red flag. I think a lot of it depends on how you’re using it. If you need to run a build to ship a one or two page marketing site or brochure site, yeah, that’s a red flag. But if you’re building some complex applications and these allow you to author in a way that’s more sensical for you and then ship less stuff to the browser, that’s not a bad thing. And that’s why I find tools like ASTRO really, really interesting because there is still a build step there, but it’s a build step in the service of providing a better end user experience.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> Yes. It’s shifting all that computation onto the server to build time or pre deferred time and not on page request time.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah. And so for me, I almost break build steps into&hellip; Like for me, the gold standard is if I can ship it without any build step at all, that’s awesome. But even for myself, the vanilla jazz guy, that’s not how I do things a hundred percent today. And so I think the next step up is compilers that reduce your code to as much HTML and plain old JavaScript as possible, versus those that create even more JavaScript, like the ones that take a bunch of little files and make an even bigger file. So more of the former, less of the latter if possible is always a good thing, but not always possible.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> I think getting off the dependency treadmill, as it were, it’s got to be a big draw to a Vanilla JavaScript approach, not having a million dependencies to be updating all the time, but I guess one of the advantages to some of these bigger frameworks is that they sometimes dictate and sometimes facilitate a uniform way of working, which is really important with larger teams. Is there a danger of a project going a bit off the rails without those standards and procedures in place that a framework imposes?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yes. Yeah. I think that’s fair. I used to downplay, I think, the significance of this for a while. And I think that is valid. That is a fair benefit of these tools. I think that maybe the small counter argument here is if you Google, &ldquo;How to do X with React,&rdquo; you’re going to get half a dozen different approaches to doing that thing. So there are conventions, but there’s not necessarily hard and fast, like if you don’t do it this way, everything breaks kind of rules. One of the appeals of these tools is that they have a lot of flexibility. Certainly they do enforce more standard approaches though than just green fields, browser native things do. And so I think there’s maybe a bit of a balance, even if you don’t have a strong team lead who’s driving internal code standards.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> I have seen even framework based projects go off the rails with hodgepodge approaches before. So it’s not like these tools automatically give you that, but they definitely give you some guidelines, maybe some rails that nudge you in the right direction. And I know some people need that. If that is something you need, this is where I really like that we’re seeing more of these smaller libraries that use the same conventions, like Petite Vue or Preact and compilers that also&hellip; Like FELT has some very rigid rails around it, certainly more so than you would see with ASTRO and so if you really need that, I think you have some options that don’t punish users for that need as much as what we had been doing a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> In the work that I do, we use Vue and the Vue single file components are a really compelling case for this in that we have engineers writing front-end code, who aren’t necessarily front-end specialists who say here’s a way to create a skeleton single file component. Your template goes here, your Java script goes here, your CSS goes here. And just naturally as a result of that, we end up with a very consistent code base, even though it’s been created by a very diverse set of people. And so the conventions like that can really have a big benefit to teams who aren’t necessarily all headed in the same direction because the engineering department’s so massive or whatever.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah, for sure. Where I think you sometimes get into trouble with that&hellip; And I agree. I absolutely like the ability to make a code base look consistent with a bunch of different people working on it is really, really important because the people writing the code today are not necessarily going to be the ones maintaining it later. And that can get messy fast. The flip side is, if you are someone who is not comfortable or really well versed in JavaScript, a lot of the modern tool set is really geared towards JavaScript. And there are a lot of people on teams who specialize primarily in HTML or CSS or accessibility. And for them, JavaScript is not a core competency nor do I think it’s fair to expect it to be. And just like you don’t expect all your JavaScript developers to be experts in CSS.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> And so it can make their job a lot harder. And this is for me, always that like that give and take with these tools is they can do some really awesome things, but they can also gate keep a lot of people out of the process. And I feel like that balance is different from team to team, but for me, one of the big arguments for leaning more on browser native stuff, or ditching as many of those dependencies as possible is that you open up your development process to a lot of people who are not as JavaScript heavy.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> There’s always this undercurrent within the industry that suggests there’s the current way of doing things, the latest and there’s the outdated way. And if you’re not up to date with whatever the latest is, you’re somehow not as good an engineer or whatever.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> In your estimation does taking a Vanilla JavaScript approach enable you to swim free of all that is Vanilla JS like an evergreen approach that stands apart from those techniques.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah. Yeah. There’s a few threads in what you just mentioned, Drew. So one of them is, if you understand the fundamentals of the web, I have found that it’s a lot easier to like a bee, just bounce from different technology to different technology and understand it enough to like&hellip; Even if you don’t use it, look at it and be like, &ldquo;Okay, I can see some benefits to this or not, and evaluate whether it’s the right choice.&rdquo; If you need to dive into a new technology based on client needs or shifting direction in the company, you can. I think it’s a lot harder to do that if you only know a library and you’ve only learned the web in the context of that library.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Now the caveat here is, I learned JavaScript in the context of jQuery and then backed my way into Vanilla JavaScript, and then moved on to a bunch of other things too. The more I think about how that process went for me though, I think I was able to do that as easily as I did in large part because by the time I made that jump, ES5 had come out and had taken a bunch of its conventions from jQuery. And so there was a lot of these real one for one map. Mental map things I could do. I don’t know if we’re quite there yet with some of the state based UI libraries, but we’re definitely headed in that direction and I think that’s great. But the other thing here, there is this real pressure, as you mentioned in the industry to always keep up to date with all these new technologies, in large part because people who develop these technologies and people who work at the big companies are the ones who get invited to speak at conferences and talk about all the cool things they’ve built.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> But the reality is that a lot of our web, like I’d say a majority of our web, runs on boring old technology that hasn’t been updated in a while, or has been updated, but in just a patch fix process. A lot of really important applications run on Python or PHP, or as a backend with just some sprinkling of lightweight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on top. jQuery is still used on a lot of important stuff to the exclusion of other libraries. And it doesn’t always feel like it because I feel like most job descriptions that you see talk about wanting experience in React or Vue or something these days. But my experience from working in bigger technology companies or older product companies, is that there are a lot of jobs to be found working on old stable technology. And a lot of times it’s not always the most exciting work, but a lot of times they’re jobs that pay well and have really great hours and a lot of work life balance in a way that you won’t get in a really exciting tech company working on the latest stuff.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> And so there’s these trade offs there. It’s not always a bad thing. Yeah, I think it’s one of those, like the new, new, new thing is potentially a very vocal minority of the web that’s not representative of as the web as a whole.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> And there seems to be along with this idea that you should be adopting everything new and immediately casting away everything that you’ve been using for the last 12 months. There’s also this idea that you should be engineering things that are enterprise grade of engineering, but you ought to be doing every small project the way that an enormous company with 400 engineers is building things. And those two ideas actually aren’t compatible at all. It’s the big companies with all these hundreds of engineers who are using the old crusty technology, because it’s reliable and they’ve got far too much momentum. They hate to be dropping it and picking up something new. So those two ideas are indirect conflict, I think.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah. It’s funny. You always see the whole like, &ldquo;Well, will it scale, will it scale,&rdquo; kind of thing all the time. And does it need to? Are you building things for a Facebook sized audience? I’m sure you’ll get there at&hellip; Well, you’ll get there, but it would be wonderful if you got there at some point, but like, if you’re not there today, maybe that’s not necessarily how you need to start out. Like those aren’t your needs today. You’re pre-engineering for a problem that you don’t have to the detriment of some problems that you do.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> I think the other thing here is there’s this presumption that because Facebook or Google or Twitter do things, it’s a good idea, or it’s a good idea for everybody. And that’s not necessarily the case. Those companies do a lot of things right. But they also do a lot of things poorly and they do them that way because of engineering trade offs they’ve had to make because of how their teams are structured or very specific internal problems they had at the time that they made this decision or because some executive somewhere felt really strongly about something and made the internal team do it, even though it wasn’t necessarily best at the time. And then these things stick around. And so, yeah, I think one of the biggest things I see happen in our industry to our own detriment is looking at those few really big visible technology companies and thinking, &ldquo;If they do it this way, I have to too,&rdquo; or &ldquo;That’s the right call for everybody.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> It’s that old, like no one got fired for hiring IBM kind of thing, but applied to if it’s good enough for Google or if it’s good enough for Twitter or whatever, so yeah. I agree. I think we do a lot of that and maybe that we shouldn’t.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> I asked on Twitter earlier on that what frustrated people about modern web development best practices and from the responses I got, there’s certainly a lot of dissatisfaction with the current state of things. One trend, which over the last few years is getting momentum is like the Jamstack approach to building sites. And it seems on the surface that this going back to just client-side apps and nothing complex on the server, it sounds like it’s going back to basics, but is it doing that? Is it or is it just masking the complexity of the stack in a different way?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> It depends. I’m a little biased here because I love the Jamstack personally, but I have also seen&hellip; Well, I shouldn’t say I have seen. I think what I’m trying to say here is the Jamstack is a term that can apply to a wide range of approaches up to and including a really large two megabyte of JavaScript single page app that has no server side rendering on one end. And then on the other end, flat HTML files that use absolutely no JavaScript at all, and instantly loading your browser and just happen to be shipped from a CDN or something like that. And technically speaking, both of those are Jamstack and are not the flat HTML thing. So Jamstack is not inherently better than server rendered, but in many cases it can be.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> So for those of you who don’t know, Jamstack used to be an acronym that stood for JavaScript, APIs and markup, and they’ve since changed the spelling and changed the definition a little bit there. And it really encompasses an approach to building the web that doesn’t rely on server side rendering. So anything you’re serving, you’ve already compiled and put together and that’s what ships in the browser. And if there’s any other processing or scripting that happens, that happens in the client. Doesn’t have to, but often does. And so what I think is awesome about Jamstack if done a certain way, is it can dramatically improve the performance of the things that you’re building.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> If you’re not just shipping like a metric ton of JavaScript to the client and having all the stuff that you used to do on the server happen in the browser instead, because the browser will always be less efficient at all that scripting than the server would be, but where this really comes to shine, and so I’ll use like WordPress as an example. I love WordPress. I built my career on WordPress. It’s the reason why I was able to become a developer, but every time someone visits a WordPress site out of the box, it has to make a call to a database, grabs some content, mash it into some templates, generate HTML and ship that back to the browser.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> And there are some plugins you can use to do some of that ahead of time, but it is a very slow process, especially on a shared inexpensive web host. A Jamstack approach would be to have that HTML file already built, and you cut&hellip; You don’t cut the server out, but you cut all of that server processing completely out. So the HTML file already exists and gets shipped. And in an ideal world, you would even push that out to a bunch of CDNs so it sits as close to the person accessing it as possible. And what that can do is take a load time from a couple of seconds on an inexpensive host to less than half a second, because of how little computing time it takes to actually just request a file, get the file back and load it, if it’s mostly HTML.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> And so, yeah, I really like rambling in long winded response to your question, Drew, but I think the answer is, if you’re using it with something like a static site generator, it can be amazingly more performant than some of the other things we’ve done in the past. And it allows you to get that same WordPress experience where I’m authoring content and I have some templates and I don’t have to hardcode HTML, but the performance is way better on one end.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> And then on the other end, you could theoretically define a React app as Jamstack as well and it can be really slow and buggy and terrible. And so it depends. The other thing I’m seeing happen that’s really, really funny and interesting is we just keep reinventing PHP over and over and over again as an industry in various ways. So-</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> We still have PHP as well. It’s not gone.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Right? And yet PHP still exists and still works great. And so we’ve got&hellip; Like I remember when Next.js came out. There was all these kind of, &ldquo;And here’s all the things you can do with it.&rdquo; And I was like, &ldquo;Oh, that’s like PHP,&rdquo; but a decade later. And then my friend Zach Leatherman who built Eleventy which is an amazing static site generator has been experimenting with some compiling in real time on the server stuff with Eleventy.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> So it’s like just in time Jamstack and he even jokes that he’s essentially recreated PHP in node and JavaScript, but it’s slightly different because there’s like a serverless build that happens that then instant deploys it to a CDN and it’s like a little weird. So it’s still a house of cards. You’re just shifting around where those cards live and who’s responsible for them, but yeah, yeah. Jamstack is cool. Jamstack is problematic. It’s also not. It’s awesome. It’s potentially overused both as a term and a technology. Yeah. It’s a whole lot of things and I love it in the same way that I love PHP. It’s great and it has problems and every technology and approach is a series of trade-offs.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> Do you think we’re going through some industrial revolution in web development? What used to be skilled painstaking work from individual arts and is now high volume, high production factory output. All the machines have been brought in and the frameworks and the build tools and have we lost that hand rolled touch?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Well, I mean, yes, to an extent, but we don’t have to. I mean, that analogy is appropriate in many ways, because a lot of the ways we do things today produce&hellip; I like to call them front end pollution in the over-reliance on JavaScript, but also in the very literal sense. We have so many heavy build processes now that they generate more actual literal pollution as well. But I think the counter argument here is with a&hellip; I will use farming, right? You could go out and hand mill your wheat with a scyther. I forget what you call those. The crescent shaped tool that you use to chop your wheat, or you could use an oxen drawn machine that will pull that off, or you can use a big tractor.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> And I think there’s a clear argument that at some point, factory farming is this big industrial complex that has lost a little bit of that close to the Earth touch, but I don’t think I necessarily need my farmers to be hand chopping their wheat. That is wildly inefficient for very little benefit. And there’s probably a balance there. And I feel the same thing with what we’re doing here. Some of these tools allow us to do more artisan work faster and more efficiently. And sometimes they just turn it into generating a bunch of garbage and turn it out as fast as possible. And there’s not necessarily a clear cut delineation for where that crossover happens. I think it’s a little fuzzy and gray and like a you know it when you see it kind of thing. Sometimes not always. But yeah, I think it’s a little bit of both. The commercialization of the web is both a really terrible thing and also a really great thing that has allowed folks like myself to have a living working on the platform that I love full time.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> That’s awesome. But it’s also produced a lot of problems and I think that’s true for any technology. There’s good and bad that comes with all of it.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> And maybe sometimes we’re just producing really fat pigs.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah. I’ve gotten a lot more like, it depends as I’ve gotten older. This stuff used to really, really upset me from a purist standpoint. And I still really hate the fact that we’ve forced our users to endorse such a fragile and easily broken web. The web in general has gotten four to five times faster in the last decade. And the average website has only gotten a hundred milliseconds faster in terms of load time, because we just keep throwing more and more stuff at our users. And we could have a really fast resilient web right now if we wanted one, but we don’t. And part of that is a natural trade off for pushing the capabilities of the web further and further and that’s awesome, but I feel like sometimes we do things just because it’s shiny and new and not because it adds real benefit to folks. So I’d love to see a little bit more balance there.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> Is part of the problem that we’re expecting the web to do too much? I mean, for many years we didn’t really have any great alternatives. So we enhanced and maybe over-stretched the high tech document system to behave like a software application. And now we’ve all got really powerful phones in our pockets, running a range of network connected apps. Is that the appropriate outlook for this functionality that we’re trying to build into websites? Should we just all be building apps for that case and leaving the document based stuff to be on the web?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> I would argue the other direction. I think the bigger problem is&hellip; So maybe there are certain things for which I even personally I prefer like a native app over something in the web. But I think having the web do more frees you from app ecosystems and allows you as a team to build a thing and be able to reach more people with it, not have to download an app before you can access the thing you want. That’s a really cool thing. And I would argue that potentially the bigger problem is that browsers can’t keep up with the pace of the thing that we want the web to do. And that’s not a knock on the people behind the standards processes. I would not want to go back to every browser just does their own thing and the hell with it. That was awful to develop for.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> It was, yeah.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> We do have some of those similar problems though, just based on how the standards process works. So sometimes you’ll see Google get frustrated because they have so much in-house development power, get frustrated with other browsers that are part of that process not wanting to go along with something or not moving fast enough. And so they just&hellip; Leeroy Jenkins it and just run off and go do whatever they want to do. On the flip side you sometimes see Apple moving very, very slow because they don’t put as much investment into the web as they do other parts of their business, which is hopefully, maybe starting to change a little bit with some of the more recent hires they’ve made. But I think one of the things you run into is just the web tends to move a little slowly sometimes.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Technology moves fast, but the browsers themselves and the technologies they implement don’t always keep up. And so I don’t believe we demand too much of our browsers. I just think you get this natural ebb and flow where we demand a lot. We build a bunch of libraries to polyfill the things that we want and then when the browser eventually catches up, there’s this really slow, petering off as library usage for that particular stuff drops off.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah. But I don’t know that I would say we demand too much of the web. Yeah, I don’t know. I actually, I love all the things the web can do. I think it’s really, for me, it’s what’s so exciting about the web. I think my frustration is more just with how slow some of these technologies are to come out, particularly on iOS devices. And I say this as someone who, I love my iPhone, but progressive web apps continue to be a second&hellip; They just don’t get as much priority as native apps do on that platform, which is disappointing.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> So looking to the future on that note, what should we, as a development community be working on to fix some of these issues? Where should we be placing our efforts?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah. So I think there are a few different things. And I think some of the tools we’ve talked about, I don’t think they’ll ever necessarily go away. They might change in form a little bit, but so I already see some cool things on the horizon. One of the things people love about single page apps that we’ve never been able to do with, I call them multistage apps, but they’re really just plain old webpages is like the nice transitions that happen between views where you might like fade in, fade out, or something like that.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> There’s a native API in the works that’s going to make that a lot easier. That’s awesome. There’s also a native API in the works for HTML sanitization. So one of the big things that libraries do for you is they, when you’re rendering HTML from third party data, they have some libraries baked in that will help reduce your risk of cross-site scripting attacks.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> There’s not really a good, just native way to do that, but there’s one in the works that will make that a lot easier. And even if you continue to use state based libraries, that should allow them to strip a bunch of code out and that would be an awesome thing.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> One thing that the native web can’t do yet that would be really cool, is a way to handle DOM dipping so that if you want to build some HTML based on a JavaScript object and then update it as the object changes, it would be really cool if you didn’t have to rely on a library for that. And that there was maybe a performant out of the box way to do that in the browser. I think that would solve a lot of problems. As well as more accessible interactive components. I absolutely love when HTML and CSS can replace something I used to need JavaScript for. Doesn’t need to be as rigorously tested, way more fault tolerant, less likely to break, more performant all around. It’s a net win. And so I’d love to see more of those come to the platform.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> So from a browser native thing there’s that. And then the other big thing I think we’re going to start to see more of is a shift away from client-side libraries and a shift to more pre-compiled stuff. Whether that’s static side generators, something like ASTRO that still uses JavaScript libraries, but pre renders them instead of making the browser do it. But those are the, I think, the big things I’m seeing start to happen and I think we’re going to see more and more of.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> So you saying maybe it’s not all doom and gloom and perhaps we can fix this? There’s a way out?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> No, yeah, I see us emerging from the dark ages slowly. And what I think is going to happen is we’re going to hit a point where much like where today people are like, &ldquo;Why does everybody still use React?&rdquo; I can imagine in 7 to 10 years time, we’re going to be like, &ldquo;Why does anybody&hellip;&rdquo; I’m sorry. Not React. jQuery. &ldquo;Why does everybody still use jQuery?&rdquo; We’re going to see the same thing with React and Vue. Like, &ldquo;Why does everybody still start a project with those?&rdquo; And there’s going to be some new libraries that are starting to emerge to solve a whole new set of problems that we haven’t even dreamed of today.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> One comment from Twitter that I really identified with was from Amy Pellegrini, who said, &ldquo;Every time I update something, everything gets broken.&rdquo; Yep. I just think we’ve all been there, haven’t we?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah. I unfortunately don’t think that will ever fully go away because even in the non-build tool era of jQuery, we used to just load it with a script element. You would run into situations where different versions would be incompatible with each other. And so you’d drop a plug in into your site and it would be like, &ldquo;Sorry, you’re running jQuery 1.83, and this requires 1.89 or higher because it added this new&hellip;&rdquo; And so there’s always been some version of that. I think it’s a lot more pronounced now because so much of it happens in the command line and spits out all these terrible errors that don’t make sense. But yeah, that unfortunately I don’t think will ever go away. I feel the pain though. That one, it’s a big part of the reason why I try and use as few dependencies as possible.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> Me too. Me too. So I’ve been learning all about the lean web or learning more about the lean web than our conversation. What have you been learning about lately, Chris?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah. Great question. So I have been going deep on service workers in part because I love their ability to both make the web faster, or even if you’re not building a progressive web app, they’re just really, really cool. One of the things I’ve absolutely loved them for though is they allow me to build a single page app like experience in terms of performance, without all the complexity of having to handle JavaScript routing and stuff. So I can have a multipage app, cache my API calls for a short period of time without having to cache them in memory. And so I’ve been able to do some really cool things with them. And then the other thing I’ve been learning a lot about lately is serverless, which allows me to get the benefits of having some server-side code without having to actually manage a server, which is great.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> And so I went really, really deep on those, put together a couple of courses on both of those topics as well, but they have benefited me immensely in my own work, in particular service workers, which has been amazing. I’m obsessed with them. Recommend them for everybody.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> That’s amazing. And where can people find those courses that you put together on?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> So if you go to vanillajsguides.com, you can dig into those and a whole bunch of other courses as well.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> Amazing. If you dear listener would like to hear more from Chris, you can find his book on the web at leanweb.dev and his developer tips newsletter, which I believe now gets over 12,000 subscribers-</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> Yeah. Up a little bit from the last time we chatted.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-host\">Drew:</span> Yeah. That’s at gomakethings.com. Chris is on twitter @chrisferdinandi. And you can check out his podcast at podcast.com or wherever you usually get your podcasts from. Thanks for joining us today, Chris. Do you have any parting words?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"smashing-tv-speaker\">Chris:</span> No, that was a really great summary, Drew. Thank you so much. You hit all the key links. So thanks so much for having me. This was great.</p>\n\n<div class=\"signature\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/logo/logo--red.png\" alt=\"Smashing Editorial\" width=\"35\" height=\"46\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" />\n  <span>(il)</span>\n</div>\n\n\n              </article>\n            </body>\n          </html>\n        "

I bet quite a few. Yet, it looked like none of the people involved saw the typo. It made it to the printer, after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this kind of thing happens all the time on projects. One of my favorite French expressions is <em>avoir la tête dans le guidon</em>. A literal translation is &#8220;having your head in the handlebar.&#8221; (The English official version is <em>having your nose in the grindstone</em>.) It comes from cycling. When cyclists are trying to win a race, at some point, they end up with their nose so close to the handlebar that nothing else around them matters. They are <strong>hyper focused on the road ahead</strong>. They can&#8217;t see anything else around anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyclist-blur.jpg?resize=1200%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Photo of a cyclist in a black helmet and red jacket on a black and blue racing bike riding through a busy intersection with a blurry backdrop indicating a fast speed.\" class=\"wp-image-357478\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyclist-blur.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyclist-blur.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyclist-blur.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyclist-blur.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cyclist-blur.jpg?resize=1000%2C500&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Credit: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@maxwbender\">Max Bender</a> via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/YOk0D5sz3e4\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is exactly what happens to us quite often on projects. We and our teams are so focused at some point on shipping the site (or printing the book) that we get <strong>blindfolded</strong> and fail to see little (or big) details anymore. This is how you ship a book about &#8220;HTLM5&#8221; and a website with navigation issues and dead ends in user flows, or features no one needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-gaining-an-external-view-with-user-testing\">Gaining an external view with user testing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to avoid these sorts of things, you need an <strong>external view</strong> of your site, product or service. And the best way to gain that view is to test it with people who are <em>not</em> on the team. We call this <strong>usability</strong> or <strong>user testing</strong>. I have to confess that I&#8217;m biased here since part of my job is to perform user testing on websites. So, I have to say that, ideally, you want to <strong>test with your target audience</strong> — the people who actually use your website, product, or service. But, <em>if</em> (and this is a big <em>if</em>) you can&#8217;t find any users, at least have a first round of tests with people who did not work directly on the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also want to test with people with <strong>different impairments</strong> to make sure the end result is  as accessible as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-when-should-i-start-testing-my-project\">When should I start testing my project?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a perfect world, you test <strong>as soon and as often as possible</strong>. Testing prototypes built in design tools before starting development is cheaper. If the concept doesn&#8217;t work, at least you did not invest three months of development into an ineffective feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also test HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototypes with fake data built for the tests — or test once the feature or website is developed. This does mean, though, that any changes are more complex and expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Define what you want to test</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to define what <strong>specific tasks</strong> or <strong>activities</strong> you want to test. Usually, you want a set of different actions with a user goal at the end. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>an account creation process</li><li>a whole checkout process</li><li>a search process from the homepage to the final blog post, etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>List the tasks and activities the user needs to accomplish in the form of questions. We call this a creating a <strong>test script</strong>. You can find <a href=\"https://methods.18f.gov/usability-test-script/\">an example here from 18F</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be careful not to bias users. This is the tricky part. For example, if you want to test an account creation flow and the button says &#8220;Sign up,&#8221; then avoid asking your test users to &#8220;sign up&#8221; because the first thing they will do is search for a button with the same verb on the screen. You could ask them to &#8220;create an account&#8221; instead and gain better insights.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_4EF70540D0679CCD6B2C1C53C1947F2CF4AD6398987E3515C3415E1808D25797_1636900426974_prototype-testing.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshots of Axure and Word side by side.\"/><figcaption>Example of a protype build in Axure and a test script</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then prepare the prototype you want to test. As mentioned before, it can range from mockups with a click-through prototype to a fully-developed prototype with real data. It&#8217;s totally up to you and how far you are in the project. Just make sure it works (technically, I mean).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Recruit participants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You know who your users are on most of your projects. The question is: how can you reach out to them? There&#8217;s plenty of ways. You might go through support or salespeople with lists of possible participants. If it&#8217;s a broad target audience, you could recruit testers right where they are. Working on an e-commerce website that sells plants? Why not try visiting actual physical shops, online communities for gardeners, community gardens, Facebook groups, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use social media to recruit participants as long as you <strong>recruit the right people</strong> who are prospective users of the site. This is why UX professionals use screeners. A screener is a set of questions you while recruiting (and when starting the test), to make sure you are working with someone who is in the target audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that participants are usually <strong>compensated for their time</strong>. It can be gift cards, maybe getting of your product, some really nice chocolate — something that encourages people to spend time with you in a way that thanks them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you struggle recruiting and have a budget, you can use professional user research recruitment websites like <a href=\"https://www.userinterviews.com\">userinterviews.com</a> or <a href=\"https://www.testingtime.com/en/\">testingtime.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Schedule, set up, prepare</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you successfully recruit participants for testing, <strong>schedule a meeting with them</strong>, including the testing date, time, and place. The test can be remote or face to face. I won&#8217;t detail the logistics here, but at some point, you will need help to set up an actual room or a virtual space for the testing. If it&#8217;s a physical room, make sure it&#8217;s calm and accessible for your users. If it&#8217;s remote, make sure the tools are accessible and people can install them if needed on their computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schedule some emails in advance to remind participants the day before the test, just in case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least: <strong>do a dry run of your test</strong> using people from your team. This helps avoid typos in the scripts and prototypes. You want to make sure the prototype works properly, that there are no technical issues, etc. You want to avoid anything that could bias the test.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Facilitate the test</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You need two testers to conduct a usability test. One person facilitates. The other takes care of the logistics and notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome the participant. You can <a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/resources/templates.html\">find a lot of templates for usability testing over at usability.gov</a>, including consent forms, email template examples, and much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start the recording,  but only if they give you permission to do so, of course. Explain that <strong>you are testing the site, not them</strong>, and that there are no right or wrong answers. Encourage them to think out loud, and to tell you exactly what they do, see, and think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put them at ease by starting with a few soft questions to get them to talk. Then follow your script.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing: <strong>don&#8217;t help users accomplish the tasks</strong>. I know, this is hard. We don&#8217;t like to see people struggle. But if you help them, you will bias the results. Of course, if they struggle for five minutes and you need them to accomplish the task to go to the next one, you can unlock them. Mark that particular task as &#8220;failed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once testing is finished, thank the test user for their time and offer them the compensation (or tell them how to get compensated if it was a remote test).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get the recording, upload it somewhere in the cloud so there is a backup. Same for your notes. Trust me on that, there&#8217;s nothing worse than losing some data because the computer crashed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Analyze and document the results</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the test, I usually like to put together a quick &#8220;first draft&#8221; of the analysis for a given participant because the testing is still fresh in my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people do this in shared documents or Excel sheets. My favorite method is using the <strong>actual screens that were used for testing in a Miro board.</strong> And I put digital sticky notes on them with the test&#8217;s main findings. I use different colors for different types of feedback, like a user comment, feature request, usability issue, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When multiple users give the same feedback or experience the same issue, I add a small dot on the  note. This way, I have a visual summary of everything that happened during all the tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"412\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/s_4EF70540D0679CCD6B2C1C53C1947F2CF4AD6398987E3515C3415E1808D25797_1636899694566_usertest-postits.jpg?resize=900%2C412&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of mockup screens in Miro with notes attached to various areas of the screens.

Learn, iterate, improve</strong>.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t test for the fun of testing. We test to improve things. So, the next step is to learn from those tests. What worked well? What can be improved? How might we improve? Of course, you might not have the time and budget to improve everything at once. My advice is to prioritize and iterate. Fix the biggest issues first. &#8220;Big&#8221; is a relative term, of course, and that depends on your project or <abbr title=\"key performance indicator\">KPI</abbr>s. It could mean &#8220;most users have this issue.&#8221; Or it could mean, &#8220;if this doesn&#8217;t get fixed, we will lose users and revenue.&#8221; This is when it becomes again, a team sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-in-conclusion\">In conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope I&#8217;ve convinced you to test your site soon and often. This was just a small introduction to the world of testing with real users. I simplified a lot in here to give you an idea of what goes into user testing. Proper professional usability testing is more complex, especially on large projects. While I always favor hiring someone dedicated to user research and testing, I also understand that it might be complicated for smaller projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to go further, I recommend checking out the following resources:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research\"><em>Just Enough Research</em></a> by Erika Hall — There is an entire chapter on interviews with great advice</li><li><a href=\"https://sensible.com/rocket-surgery-made-easy/\"><em>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</em></a> by Steve Krug — The definitive book on user testing.</li><li><a href=\"https://confrere.com/about/how-we-work/user-testing/\">&#8220;User testing&#8221;</a> by Ida Aalen — Great information on testing with a limited budget.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/qual-usability-testing-study-guide/\">&#8220;Qualitative Usability Testing: Study Guide&#8221;</a> by Kate Moran — This is a collection of links to Nielson Norman Group articles and videos to about planning, conducting, and analyzing qualitative user testing.</li><li><a href=\"https://stories.justinewin.com/making-note-taking-easier-during-a-usability-test-b101dfdf2d6b\">&#8220;Making Note-taking Easier During A Usability Test&#8221;</a> by Justine Win</li><li><a href=\"https://maze.co/guides/usability-testing/\">&#8220;A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Usability Testing&#8221;</a> by Maze</li><li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/videos/what-should-you-test/\">&#8220;You Can’t Test Everything, So What Should You Test?&#8221;</a> by Maria Rosala— This is a five-minute video that explains how to prioritize what to test.</li><li><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/stories/2020/05/11/remote-usability-testing-tips\">&#8220;Run more effective remote usability tests with these 5 tips&#8221;</a> by Renee Fleck</li><li><a href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-testing/remote-usability-testing/?ref=uxdesignweekly\">&#8220;Remote Usability Testing 101 &amp; How to Get Started&#8221;</a> by Justin Morales</li><li><a href=\"https://boagworld.com/working-in-web/ux-design-tools/\">&#8220;The Best UX Design Tools You Need for Testing&#8221;</a> by Paul Boag</li><li><a href=\"https://frozenrockets.nl/articles/en/user-testing-with-disabled-people\">&#8220;Things to consider when doing usability testing with disabled people&#8221;</a> by Peter van Grieken</li><li><a href=\"https://makeitfable.com/\">Fable</a> — This is a panel that helps recruit people with disabilities for user testing.</li></ul>\n"

We&#8217;ll also survey the best cloud providers, and dig into AWS services in particular and what cloud certification is all about.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"gettingstartedwithcloudcomputing\">Getting Started with Cloud Computing</h2>\n<p>When starting your cloud computing career, one of the first steps is to choose a cloud provider. Using that cloud provider&#8217;s services, you&#8217;ll be able to learn about various cloud computing concepts and get to practice your skills .</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisacloudprovider\">What is a cloud provider?</h3>\n<p>A cloud provider is a company that offers you computing services over the Internet. In the simplest terms, it allows you to store and run your applications on somebody else&#8217;s computers. </p>\n<p>In reality, you can do more than this with a cloud provider, and you&#8217;ll get a glimpse of that in this article!</p>\n<h3 id=\"whyuseacloudprovider\">Why use a cloud provider?</h3>\n<p>Rather than purchasing equipment, setting up your infrastructure, and maintaining it, you can use a cloud provider.</p>\n<p>This way, you can focus on building and maintaining your applications without worrying about the physical infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcloudprovidertouse\">What Cloud Provider to Use?</h2>\n<p>There are many cloud providers available, and there&#8217;s no right or wrong answer when choosing one. Some of the most popular cloud service providers are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>\n<li>Microsoft Azure</li>\n<li>Google Cloud</li>\n<li>IBM</li>\n<li>Oracle</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amazon Web Services is the biggest and most popular cloud provider. Another strong point of AWS is its certification program. Amazon&#8217;s certifications are among the highest-paying certifications in IT.</p>\n<p>As a result, this article focuses on AWS for your introduction to cloud computing. The AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate is Amazon&#8217;s foundational course, which teaches the fundamentals of cloud computing and AWS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"awscertifications\">AWS Certifications</h2>\n<p>Amazon Web Services offers 11 certifications that are divided into four categories.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1637904906aws-certifications.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of all AWS certifications\" /></p>\n<p><small>AWS certifications</small></p>\n<p>The <strong>Foundational Level</strong> has only one certification, the <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-2020-3110\">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a> certificate. It covers topics such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the fundamentals of cloud computing</li>\n<li>basic AWS information</li>\n<li>the key AWS services</li>\n<li>billing and pricing</li>\n<li>security</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Cloud Practitioner certificate is suitable and recommended for people who are getting started with cloud computing and AWS. To ease you into the cloud world, this article goes over cloud computing and AWS fundamentals. You can use it as a pre-requisite for the Cloud Practitioner certificate.</p>\n<p>The next level is the <strong>Associate Level</strong>, which has three certifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solutions Architect</li>\n<li>SysOps Administrator</li>\n<li>Developer Associate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These certifications are more complex than the foundational level, and they teach you how to implement solutions using the AWS infrastructure. With the &#8220;Associate Level&#8221; certificates, you deep dive into services rather than getting an overview of them.</p>\n<p>The certificate you choose depends on the path you want to follow. The AWS Solutions Architect certificate helps you gain general AWS expertise. Since it enables you to gain general AWS expertise, you can use it as the foundation for your following certificates.</p>\n<p>After the <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-2020-3110\">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a> certificate, you could work towards the Solutions Architect one. </p>\n<p>The following levels, <strong>Professional Level</strong> and <strong>Specialty</strong>, are the most difficult certifications. You don&#8217;t have to worry about them for now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcloudcomputingis\">What Cloud Computing Is</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with some fundamental information on cloud concepts. The first question you might ask yourself is &#8220;what is cloud computing?&#8221;</p>\n<p>In layman&#8217;s terms, cloud computing is simply like using someone else&#8217;s computer. Instead of having your servers, you rent the servers from someone like AWS.</p>\n<p>In more sophisticated terms, cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofcloudcomputing\">The Benefits of Cloud Computing</h2>\n<p>When it comes to cloud computing, there are six significant benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Variable expense versus capital expense</strong>. This means you only pay when you use resources, unlike on-premise resources, where you need to invest a hefty sum beforehand.</li>\n<li><strong>No capacity guessing</strong>. You avoid under-utilization or over-utilization of resources. That means you don&#8217;t have to pay for underutilized resources, or have your applications down from over-utilized resources. Cloud computing enables you to rapidly scale up or down in response to changing business needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased speed and agility</strong>. Cloud computing allows you to create or terminate resources within minutes. You don&#8217;t have to wait for your IT team for weeks to implement on-premise solutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Benefit from massive economies of scale</strong>. You&#8217;re splitting the cost with other customers to receive significant discounts.</li>\n<li><strong>Go global</strong>. Deploy your applications to various locations worldwide with minimal effort.</li>\n<li><strong>Spending money on running and maintaining data centers</strong>. Avoid the headaches, costs, time, and other resources associated with infrastructure development. Let others handle it and focus on your applications.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now you know what cloud computing is and its six significant benefits. The next stage is to become familiar with the various types of cloud computing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typesofcloudcomputing\">Types of Cloud Computing</h2>\n<p>There are three types of Cloud Computing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>IaaS</strong> (<strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong> &#8211; for admins). You are responsible for managing your servers (either physical or virtual). </li>\n<li><strong>PaaS</strong> (<strong>Platform as a Service</strong> &#8211; for developers). There&#8217;s no need for you to manage the underlying architecture. You&#8217;re only concerned with deploying and running your applications. An example would be Heroku (where you deploy and run web applications).</li>\n<li><strong>SaaS</strong> (<strong>Software as a Service</strong> &#8211; for customers). This is a final product that the service provider runs and manages. Google&#8217;s Gmail is one example. You don&#8217;t have to worry about anything other than using the service.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"cloudcomputingdeployments\">Cloud Computing Deployments</h2>\n<p>In addition to the three cloud computing services, there are four cloud computing deployments. These are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Public</strong>: fully utilizing cloud computing. Examples are AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM, Alibaba, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid</strong>: using a mix of public and private deployments. Sensitive and critical information might be stored in a &#8220;private&#8221; cloud, whereas other information is stored on the &#8220;public&#8221; cloud.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Private</strong>: deploying resources on-premise and using virtualization and resource management tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Cloud</strong>: a multi-cloud architecture uses various cloud service providers. For instance, you could use a mix of AWS and Google Cloud.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"awsinfrastructure\">AWS Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>At the time of writing, Amazon has&nbsp;<em>81+ availability zones</em> within&nbsp;<em>25+ geographic regions</em>. There are over 230+ <em>points of presence</em>, split as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>218+ edge locations</li>\n<li>12+ regional edge caches</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A <strong>region</strong> is a geographic area, and it consists of at least two availability zones (AZs). The reason for having at least two AZs is in case one of the data centers goes down. For example, one region is <strong>eu-west-1 (Ireland)</strong>. Every region is independent of each other, and the&nbsp;<strong>US-EAST</strong> is the largest region. As a result, almost all services become available first in this region.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An <strong>availability zone</strong> is a data center (a building containing lots of physical servers). An availability zone might consist of several data centers, but they&#8217;re counted as one AZ because they&#8217;re close to each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Points of presence</strong> are data centers placed at the edge of the networks.</p>\n<p>An <strong>edge location</strong> is an AWS endpoint for caching content. That&#8217;s typically CloudFront, which is AWS&#8217;s content delivery network. The purpose of these edge locations is to provide low latency for the end users.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a unique region that&#8217;s not available to everyone. This region is called&nbsp;<strong>GovCloud</strong>, and it&#8217;s only accessible to companies from the US and US citizens. You also have to pass a screening process.&nbsp;<em>GovCloud allows users to host sensitive Controlled Unclassified Information such as military information.</em></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/cloud-computing-aws-certification/?utm_source=rss\">An Introduction to Cloud Computing and AWS Certification</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Keras is a high-level library in Python that is a wrapper over <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow\">TensorFlow</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk\">CNTK</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Theano/Theano\">Theano</a>.

An ANN works with hidden layers, each of which is a transient form associated with a probability. In a typical neural network, each node of a layer takes all nodes of the previous layer as input. A model may have one or more hidden layers.</p>\n<p>ANNs receive an input layer to transform it through hidden layers. An ANN is initialized by assigning random weights and biases to each node of the hidden layers. As the training data is fed into the model, it modifies these weights and biases using the errors generated at each step. Hence, our model &#8220;learns&#8221; the pattern when going through the training data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"convolutedneuralnetworks\">Convoluted Neural Networks</h2>\n<p>In this tutorial, we&#8217;re going to identify digits — which is a simple version of image classification. An image is essentially a collection of dots or pixels. A pixel can be identified through its component colors (RGB). Therefore, the input data of an image is essentially a 2D array of pixels, each representing a color.</p>\n<p>If we were to train a regular neural network based on image data, we&#8217;d have to provide a long list of inputs, each of which would be connected to the next hidden layer. This makes the process difficult to scale up.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em;\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\" src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1571317613cnn.jpeg\" alt=\"Convolutional Neural Network Architecture\" width=\"569\" height=\"202\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-173921\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1571317613cnn.jpeg 569w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1571317613cnn-300x107.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" /><span style=\"display:block; font-size:0.8em; text-align:center; margin: 0;\"><a href=\"https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/\">Convolutional Neural Network Architecture</a></span>\n</div>\n<p>In a <strong>convoluted neural network</strong> (CNN), the layers are arranged in a 3D array (X-axis coordinate, Y-axis coordinate and color).

In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll use the <a href=\"http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\">MNIST dataset</a> of handwritten digits. This dataset is a part of the Keras package. It contains a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. We&#8217;ll train the data on the training set and validate the results based on the test data. Further, we&#8217;ll create an image of our own to test whether the model can correctly predict it.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s import the MNIST dataset from Keras. The <code>.load_data()</code> method returns both the training and testing datasets:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">from keras.datasets import mnist\r\n\r\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let&#8217;s try to visualize the digits in the dataset. If you&#8217;re using Jupyter notebooks, use the following magic function to show inline <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/plot-charts-python-matplotlib/\">Matplotlib plots</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">%matplotlib inline\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, import the <code>pyplot</code> module from <code>matplotlib</code> and use the <code>.imshow()</code> method to display the image:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nimage_index = 35\r\nprint(y_train[image_index])\r\nplt.imshow(x_train[image_index], cmap='Greys')\r\nplt.show()\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The label of the image is printed and then the image is displayed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1571317840image.png\" alt=\"label printed and image displayed\" width=\"912\" height=\"646\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-173923\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1571317840image.png 912w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1571317840image-300x213.png 300w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1571317840image-768x544.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px\" /></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s verify the sizes of the training and testing datasets:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">print(x_train.shape)\r\nprint(x_test.shape)\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that each image has the dimensions 28 x 28:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">(60000, 28, 28)\r\n(10000, 28, 28)\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we may also wish to explore the dependent variable, stored in <code>y_train</code>. Let&#8217;s print all labels till the digit that we visualized above:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">print(y_train[:image_index + 1])\r\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">[5 0 4 1 9 2 1 3 1 4 3 5 3 6 1 7 2 8 6 9 4 0 9 1 1 2 4 3 2 7 3 8 6 9 0 5]\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"cleaningdata\">Cleaning Data</h2>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve seen the structure of the data, let&#8217;s work on it further before creating the model.</p>\n<p>To work with the Keras API, we need to reshape each image to the format of <code>(M x N x 1)</code>. we&#8217;ll use the <code>.reshape()</code> method to perform this action. Finally, normalize the image data by dividing each pixel value by 255 (since RGB values can range from 0 to 255):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\"># save input image dimensions\r\nimg_rows, img_cols = 28, 28\r\n\r\nx_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], img_rows, img_cols, 1)\r\nx_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], img_rows, img_cols, 1)\r\n\r\nx_train /= 255\r\nx_test /= 255\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we need to convert the dependent variable in the form of integers to a binary class matrix. This can be achieved by the <code>to_categorical()</code> function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">from keras.utils import to_categorical\r\nnum_classes = 10\r\n\r\ny_train = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)\r\ny_test = to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re now ready to create the model and train it!</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/keras-digit-recognition-tutorial/?utm_source=rss\">A Beginner’s Guide to Keras: Digit Recognition in 30 Minutes</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Many languages support the idea of higher-order functions, including JavaScript, Java, .NET, Python and even PHP, to name a few.</strong></p>\n<p>But what is a higher-order function and why would we want to use one? What advantages does it give us and can we use it to simplify our code? In this article, we&#8217;ll talk about higher-order functions in PHP specifically, but will show how they&#8217;ve been used in other languages for comparison.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firstclassfunctions\">First-Class Functions</h2>\n<p>Before we can get into what a higher-order function is, we must first understand that we have to have a language that can support a feature called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function\">first-class functions</a> (aka first-order functions). This means that the language treats functions as first-class citizens. In other words, the language treats functions like it does variables. You can store a function in a variable, pass it to other functions as a variable, return them from functions like variables and even store them in data structures like arrays or object properties like you can with variables. Most modern languages these days have this feature by default. All you really need to know is that a function can be passed around and used much like variables are. </p>\n<p>For our purposes, we&#8217;ll be focusing mostly on passing functions as arguments and returning functions as results, and briefly touching on the concept of non-local variables and closures. (You can read more about these concepts in sections <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function#Higher-order_functions:_passing_functions_as_arguments\">1.1</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function#Higher-order_functions:_returning_functions_as_results\">1.4</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function#Non-local_variables_and_closures\">1.3</a> of the Wikipedia article that was linked to in the previous paragraph.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarehigherorderfunctions\">What Are Higher-order Functions?</h2>\n<p>There are two main characteristics that identify a higher-order function. A higher-order function can implement just one or both of the following ideas: a function that takes one or more functions as an input or returns a function as an output. In PHP there&#8217;s a keyword that&#8217;s a clear giveaway that a function is higher-order: the keyword <code>callable</code>. While this keyword doesn&#8217;t have to be present, the keyword makes it easy to identify them. If you see a function or method that has a callable parameter, it means that it takes a function as input. Another easy sign is if you see a function return a function using its <code>return</code> statement. The return statement might be just the name of the function, or could even be an anonymous/in-line function. Below are some examples of each type.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">// Simple user-defined function we'll pass to our higher-order function\r\nfunction echoHelloWorld() {\r\n  echo \"Hello World!\";\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Higher-order function that takes a function as an input and calls it\r\nfunction higherOrderFunction(callable $func) {\r\n  $func();\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Call our higher-order function and give it our echoHelloWorld() function. \r\n// Notice we pass just the name as a string and no parenthesis.\r\n// This echos \"Hello World!\"\r\nhigherOrderFunction('echoHelloWorld'); \r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here are some simple examples of higher-order functions that return a function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">// Returns an existing function in PHP called trim(). Notice it's a simple string with no parentheses.\r\nfunction trimMessage1() {\r\n  return 'trim';\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Here's an example using an anonymous inline function\r\nfunction trimMessage2() {\r\n    return function($text) {\r\n        return trim($text);\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Returns the 'trim' function\r\n$trim1 = trimMessage1(); \r\n\r\n// Call it with our string to trim\r\necho $trim1('  hello world  ');\r\n\r\n// Returns the anonymous function that internally calls 'trim'\r\n$trim2 = trimMessage1(); \r\n\r\n// Call it again with our string to trim\r\necho $trim2('  hello world  ');\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can imagine, you can take in a function and also use that to generate another function that&#8217;s returned. Pretty neat trick, right? But why would you want to do any of this? It sounds like something that would simply make things more complicated.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whywouldyouuseorcreateahigherorderfunction\">Why Would You Use or Create a Higher-order Function?</h2>\n<p>There are several reasons you might want to create higher-order functions in your code. Everything from code flexibility, code reuse, code extension or to imitate a code solution you saw in another program. While the reasons are numerous, we&#8217;ll cover a few of them here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"addingcodeflexibility\">Adding code flexibility</h3>\n<p>Higher-order functions add a ton of flexibility. Based on the previous examples, you probably can see a few uses for something like this. You can write a single function that takes in a whole suite of different functions and uses them without having to write code to execute them individually. </p>\n<p>Maybe the higher-order function itself doesn&#8217;t know what type of function it will receive. Who said that the function has to know anything about the function it&#8217;s taking in? One minute the input function could be an <code>add()</code> function, and in the next it could be a <code>divide()</code> function. In either case it just works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"easilyexpandyourcode\">Easily expand your code</h3>\n<p>This functionality also makes it easier to add additional input functions later. Let&#8217;s say you have <code>add()</code> and <code>divide()</code>, but down the road you need to add a <code>sum()</code> function. You can write the <code>sum()</code> function and pipe it through the higher-order function without ever having to change it. In a later example, we&#8217;ll demonstrate how we can use this functionality to create our own <code>calc()</code> function.</p>\n<h3 id=\"imitatefeaturesofanotherlanguage\">Imitate features of another language</h3>\n<p>Another reason you might want to use a higher-order function in PHP is to simulate the behavior of something like a decorator in Python. You “wrap” a function inside another function to modify how that function behaves. For instance, you could write a function that times other functions. You write a higher-order function that takes in a function, starts a timer, calls the function, then ends the timer to see how much time has elapsed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"examplesofexistinghigherorderfunctionsinphp\">Examples of Existing Higher-Order Functions in PHP</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s really simple to find examples of higher-order functions in PHP. Look at the <a href=\"https://www.php.net/docs.php\">PHP documentation</a> and find a function/method that takes a <code>callable</code> input parameter and you&#8217;ve found one. Below are a few examples of commonly used higher-order functions. You might have even used them without ever knowing they were higher-order functions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thehigherorderdynamicduoarray_mapandarray_filter\">The higher-order dynamic duo: <code>array_map</code> and <code>array_filter</code></h3>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">$arrayOfNums = [1,2,3,4,5];\r\n\r\n// array_map: example of taking an inline anonymous function\r\n$doubledNums = array_map(function($num) {\r\n  return $num * 2;\r\n}, $arrayOfNums);\r\n\r\nvar_dump($doubledNums); // Prints out array containing [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how to use another one, this time with a filter function we&#8217;ve defined separately:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">$arrayOfNums = [1,2,3,4,5];\r\n\r\n// Example of creating a function and giving it to a higher-order function array_filter()\r\nfunction isEven($num) {\r\n  return ($num % 2) === 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// array_filter is a higher-order function\r\n$evenNums = array_filter($arrayOfNums, 'isEven');\r\n\r\nvar_dump($evenNums); // Prints out array containing [2, 4]\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>array_filter</code> and <code>array_map</code> are two very popular higher-order functions that you&#8217;ll find in plenty of code projects. Another one you might use is <code>call_user_func</code>, which takes in a function and a list of arguments and calls on that function. This is essentially a customized higher-order function. Its whole purpose is to call other functions that the user has defined:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">function printCustomMessage($message) {\r\n  echo \"$message\";\r\n}\r\n\r\ncall_user_func('printCustomMessage', 'Called custom message through the use of call_user_func!');\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/functional-programming-in-php-higher-order-functions/?utm_source=rss\">Functional Programming in PHP: Higher-order Functions</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Many enterprise organizations believe that WordPress is simply a platform used by smaller companies, entrepreneurs, freelancers and companies who don&#8217;t have a robust or sophisticated infrastructure. But what if this simply isn&#8217;t the case?</strong> </p>\n<p>This article will discuss five strategies that can help you take advantage of the easy-to-use functionality of WordPress. We&#8217;ll also leverage the enormous community support to develop an enterprise-ready site. But first we&#8217;ll talk a bit about the reasons enterprises are hesitant to use this platform for their next enterprise project and why those reasons are unfounded.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enterprisehesitancy\">Enterprise Hesitancy</h2>\n<p>WordPress originally started as a blogging platform but quickly adapted to general website use. Today, it&#8217;s estimated that WordPress may power as much as <a href=\"https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/wordpress-statistics\">35–40% of the websites on the Internet</a>, and nearly 28% of all ecommerce goes through WooCommerce (a WordPress plugin and system). However, many IT professionals and experienced developers still see the platform as only for blogging, and consider that it&#8217;s not suited to handling the larger needs of enterprises, which may need to integrate with their services. Many organizations see their systems as proprietary systems that are &#8220;too unique&#8221; for WordPress, and believe that it just won&#8217;t fit into their infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Another fear that IT/development staff have about WordPress is that, to get the site up and running, and working with their system, they have to start from scratch. This is simply not the case. WordPress has done a very nice job of getting the main platform installed in as little as five minutes. In addition, through the use of sophisticated plugins, WordPress can tap into standardized systems, work with cloud services, provide SAML or OAuth2 functionality, and more. Even if you don&#8217;t find a plugin that does everything you need, it&#8217;s easy to build plugins and extend the platform to connect to your own proprietary system. We&#8217;ll look into some of that in this article.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there&#8217;s a belief that WordPress is just not secure enough. Why do they think this? Well, perhaps it&#8217;s because they see a lot of security updates. But shouldn&#8217;t that tell you that WordPress is so active on the security front that it&#8217;s finding and fixing problems before your IT department even wakes up in the morning? With such a large footprint in the online world, and with so many companies using it, there are thousands and thousands of developers looking at every inch of core. Then with plugins (which can be written by anyone, that is true) we can apply a bit of basic discipline to only pick the best and vet what plugins we allow. Everything is open source, so all plugins are an open book and you can have your devs crawl through them and look for anything that may impact the organization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thestrategies\">The Strategies</h2>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve addressed some of the hesitancy and myths lurking about WordPress in the enterprise context, we can talk about some strategies for making WordPress something that could work for a company of any size. While these strategies will cover many topics, there&#8217;s always more that you can do. Be sure to look for more information on <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/library/\">sitepoint.com</a> as you explore these strategies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"strategy1identifywhatyouneedandlockitdown\">Strategy 1: Identify what you need and lock it down</h3>\n<p>This is your standard security strategy for WordPress. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>First make sure that you set up the platform using the famous <strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/\">five minute install guide</a></strong>. One thing to pay attention to is generating your secure salts. This is super easy to do and will give you that extra layer of protection.</li>\n<li><strong>Set up SSL</strong>. Pretty standard really.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your <code>wp-config.php</code> file</strong>. This file is a great place to put your secrets, passwords, API keys and links to the platform and also your enterprise services. I&#8217;d recommend not committing this file to your repositories and instead just keep a backup of it somewhere. Then you can give it to new developers who may need it. You can even move this file to a different location that&#8217;s not accessible by the public and then reference the file. If you do a search about moving <code>wp-config.php</code>, you can find tons of information on the topic. In addition to moving it, you can also add a configuration to your web server configs or <code>.htaccess</code> file to simply deny direct access to the file.</li>\n<li><strong>Move the login page</strong> for your admin panel. Typically, this page is found at <code>https://&lt;yoursite.com&gt;/wp-admin</code>. You can also change this URL to be some other location. There are plugins that can assist you with this.</li>\n<li><strong>Put the site behind a CDN</strong> or service like CloudFlare or CloudFront for even more security. </li>\n<li><strong>Remove any labeling</strong> that mentions the WordPress version. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>To complete point 6 above, you can use this simple code provided below to do this in two spots, putting them in your <code>functions.php</code> file.</p>\n<p>Do the following to remove the version number in the header and RSS:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">function remove_wp_head_version() {\r\n  return '';\r\n}\r\nadd_filter('the_generator', 'remove_wp_head_version');\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>And to remove the version details from scripts and CSS files, do this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">function remove_wp_styles_scripts( $src ) {\r\n  if ( strpos( $src, 'ver=' . get_bloginfo( 'version' ) ) ) {\r\n    $src = remove_query_arg( 'ver', $src );\r\n  }\r\n  return $src;\r\n}\r\n\r\nadd_filter( 'style_loader_src', 'remove_wp_styles_scripts');\r\nadd_filter( 'script_loader_src', 'remove_wp_styles_scripts');\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to take things even further, check out the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/hardening-wordpress/\">WordPress hardening guide</a> for more tips! Again, the WordPress development community has thought a lot about security. So be sure to follow this guide to the extent your organization wishes to go.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/make-wordpress-enterprise-ready/?utm_source=rss\">5 Easy Strategies to Make WordPress Enterprise-ready in 2021</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

            "<p>We've long believed that automation testing is a wonderful formula for improving the quality of apps right from the start. However, it is only when we begin automating that we grasp the true reality. We frequently confront issues such as deciding when to start automating tests, what tests to automate, how to choose the correct technology, and how to write automation test scripts that follow the best practices.</p>\n\n<p>So let’s discuss all this in detail in this article.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#what-is-test-automation-and-how-does-it-work\">\n  </a>\n  What is Test Automation and how does it work?\n</h2>\n\n<p>It is a method in which automation tools run a test suite, perform predetermined actions on a software application, report on the results, compare them, and generate detailed test reports.</p>\n\n<p>Test automation requires financial and human resources, long development cycles, and repeated executions. However, before we begin automating tests, we must first determine the best time for automation, the breadth of automation, and the best tool for automation. It might lead your project to unexpected additional costs if this process is not done properly from the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>Automated tests can be done across several servers during off-peak hours (midnight) and consume a fraction of the time that manual testing takes. This implies that the developer and tester’s time is used in the most efficient way possible, and the team receives faster feedback on code quality.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#criteria-for-automation\">\n  </a>\n  Criteria for Automation\n</h2>\n\n<p>To be automated, a test must match certain conditions; otherwise, it may wind up costing more than it saves. After all, saving time, effort, and money is a fundamental purpose of automation.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some general test automation criteria. Keep in mind that these are only suggestions. Depending on your circumstances, your criteria may differ.</p>\n\n<p>Repeatable: The test must be able to be repeated. Automating a test that can only be run once makes no sense. The following three steps comprise a repeatable test:</p>\n\n<p>Configure the test, including the data and the environment.<br>\nExecute the function and determine the outcome.<br>\nClean up the data as well as the surroundings..<br>\nWe want to be able to make the environment consistent in the initial phase.</p>\n\n<p>Determinant: When a function is determinant, the result is the same each time it is performed with the same input. The same may be said for automated tests. Let's imagine we wish to put an additional function to the test. We now know that 1+1=2, and that 394.19 + 5.81 = 400.00. The function of addition is determinant. Software, on the other hand, may have such a large number of varied inputs that getting the same result over time is challenging. Some variables may be completely random, making it difficult to predict a specific outcome.</p>\n\n<p>Unopinionated: You cannot automate matters of opinion. This is where usability testing, beta testing, and so forth really shine. User feedback is important, but it just can’t be automated … sorry!</p>\n\n<p>Most devs say software test automation demands considerable investments of money and resources. But UI-licious makes it easy to implement and maintain. We created this all-in-one automation tool with the desire to deliver better web experiences for everyone in mind.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#testing-at-different-levels\">\n  </a>\n  Testing at different levels\n</h3>\n\n<p>A strategy to decide the number of tests to automate is the test automation pyramid. This strategy suggests writing three types of tests with different levels of granularity. The higher the level, the fewer tests there are to write.</p>\n\n<p>Unit testing offers software products with robustness as a firm base. It's simple to write and execute tests when you test particular pieces of the code.<br>\nThe service layer refers to evaluating an application's services separately from its user interface; these services include everything that the application does in response to a single or multiple inputs.<br>\nWe have UI testing at the top level, which has fewer tests due to many attributes that make them more difficult to run, such as the fragility of the tests, where a tiny change in the user interface can break a large number of tests, requiring additional maintenance effort.<br>\nType of automated tests<br>\nKnowing what are the different forms of automated testing is critical when it comes to integrating test automation in your QA department. This will give you a good idea of how comprehensive a test automation program is, and if you can integrate it into your present quality assurance procedures or not. Furthermore, understanding the various sorts of tests allows you to make informed decisions about which types of testing would produce the best results for your organization.</p>\n\n<p>There are many different types of test automation. The following is a comprehensive list of the most common ones:</p>\n\n<p>Code Analysis: Static and dynamic code analysis tools are just two of the numerous types of code analysis tools available. Some of these checks are for security issues, while others are for style and form. When a developer checks in code, these tests are run. There isn't much test writing to perform with these automated tests other than configuring rules and keeping the tools up to date.<br>\nUnit Testing: Unit testing is doing tests on individual components in isolation to ensure that they function properly. It is commonly the first type of automated testing performed on an application because it is usually done during the development phase.<br>\nIntegration Testing: Integration testing entails testing the application's various elements as a whole. When it comes to automation, integration tests are a unique kind. Integration tests, often known as end-to-end tests, are more difficult to put up since they must interface with external dependencies. When working with resources that aren't under your control, it's often beneficial to construct false external resources.<br>\nPerformance Testing: Performance testing is putting a piece of software through its paces, stability, and responsiveness while under load. The fundamental goal of performance testing is to detect and eliminate any potential performance bottlenecks so that the program can offer the best results to the end-user. Performance testing is an important part of assuring a product's market success since it helps uncover potential issues that consumers may encounter, such as slow software functioning under a heavy workload.<br>\nRegression Testing: Regression testing is a sort of maintenance testing. It entails running functional and non-functional tests again to see if the software behaves the same way it did previously after a code or program change. The software is said to have regressed if the performance is no longer the same. The primary goal of regression testing is to guarantee that existing functionality is not harmed as a result of code changes.<br>\nSmoke Testing: Smoke testing, also known as \"Build Verification Testing\" and \"Confidence Testing,\" is a series of tests designed to evaluate the stability and viability of the software's delivered build. Smoke testing is used to determine whether an application should be shelved due to lack of functioning or moved on to the next stage of testing. Once the generated software functions have been merged with the software build, smoke testing is performed. Any failures in testing at this stage will almost always result in the application being sent back to the development team for changes.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#why-use-automated-tests\">\n  </a>\n  Why use automated tests?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Pocket-friendly<br>\nContrary to popular belief, automated testing can be less expensive than manual testing. You can't conduct repeating tests with manual testing. In reality, the cost of manually testing your application increases over time. Automated testing, on the other hand, is less expensive in the long run since once you've built your test scripts, you can reuse them at any time without incurring additional costs. True, automation adoption is initially costly, but it will quickly pay for itself.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to remember that the amount of the automated testing ROI is determined by the extent of automation adoption. The bigger the return on investment is, the more automated test cases you create and use.</p>\n\n<p>Time-Saving<br>\nYou can save time by automating your tests. Automated tests are quick to complete and can be repeated. To put it another way, you won't have to wait weeks to do the tests again — only a few hours will be enough.</p>\n\n<p>Automated testing accelerates development by taking advantage of their quick execution and repeatability. Transitioning from manual testing to automation will shorten your development time and increase your productivity.</p>\n\n<p>Better Accuracy<br>\nYou're more likely to have error-free releases if you use test automation. Automated testing is more accurate than manual testing because it requires less human intervention. The problem is that a human tester can make mistakes at any stage of the review process. The machine, on the other hand, will not cooperate. Because generated test cases are more precise than human testers, you can lower the likelihood of failure by removing human errors.</p>\n\n<p>Immediate Feedback<br>\nAnother advantage of automated testing is that it provides immediate feedback. Developers receive testing reports instantaneously with fast test execution, so they can react swiftly if a problem happens. Forget about deciphering the code that was written three weeks ago.</p>\n\n<p>When your app is already on the market, immediate feedback is very useful. Manual testing can simply slow down the process if you need to fix some errors immediately. Test automation, on the other hand, will allow you to make quick changes to your application. As a result, automated testing leads to increased team responsiveness, improved user experience, and increased customer satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>DevOps Implementation<br>\nEvery developer's commit to the source code must be tested as part of the CI/CD pipeline, and there's no other way to accomplish it fast and efficiently than with test automation. As a result, once you've deployed automated testing, transitioning to Continuous Testing and Delivery will be simple. When the complexity of the code and the number of test cases increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that we created a solution called UI-licious which is an all-in-one automation tool that helps anyone automate tests in minutes, not in hours. With our flexible testing solution, experienced testers, as well as non-coding beginners, can ensure that crucial error scenarios are quickly identified, so users do not encounter any unexpected failures when browsing your website or web app.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#when-to-use-automated-testing\">\n  </a>\n  When to use automated testing?\n</h3>\n\n<p>If you're running the same test again and again without altering it, it's likely that automating it would save you a lot of time. That's because having a manual task done on a frequent basis wastes your team's time and is likely to result in additional errors due to inattention.</p>\n\n<p>Human error is no longer a possibility thanks to automation. As a result, the adoption of automated testing can drastically increase quality in particular cases.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that if you can save money while still delivering a high-quality product, do so. This is where automation really shines. Most automation technologies aren't cheap, so the project must be large enough to justify the investment. However, UI-licious has plans starting from $12 a month, which happen to be very cost-effective and pocket-friendly.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#common-misconceptions-about-automation-testing\">\n  </a>\n  Common Misconceptions about Automation testing\n</h3>\n\n<p>It is both true and incorrect that test automation will allow you to have more free time. The majority of manual testing time is spent on exploratory and functional testing, which involves manually searching for faults. Once that process is finished, the manual tester must perform the identical actions over and over again. That time is greatly reduced with automated testing. Instead of writing tests, automation testers spend their time coding them and improving them as needed. However, after the test is completed, automated testing enables for the reuse of tests, eliminating the need to repeat the entire procedure.</p>\n\n<p>Automated testing allows you to concentrate on more important topics like client needs, functionality, and enhancements. Furthermore, the software tests can be run each time the source code is amended. Manually performing these tests is time-consuming and expensive, whereas automated tests can be done repeatedly at no additional cost.</p>\n\n<p>Investing in automated testing may appear to be prohibitively expensive at first, especially if you're a small business. But that's not the case with UI-licious, our pricing is cost-effective because you can create tests fast. Indeed, you don't need to hire an expert who is proficient in a particular coding language to write your tests. Moreover, the monthly fee is derisory compared to most of the similar solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Another prevalent misunderstanding concerning automated testing is that it eliminates the need for human involvement. In all honesty, automated testing is more precise and faster than what people can accomplish without incurring significant human error, thus this misunderstanding is acceptable. This does not replace the need for face-to-face communication in software development. Instead, it increases that aspect by giving an additional communication route.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#what-to-and-not-to-automate\">\n  </a>\n  What to and not to automate\n</h3>\n\n<p>Without necessarily automating tests end-to-end, testing tools can assist with tasks such as product installation, test data creation, GUI interaction, problem detection (think parsing or polling agents equipped with test oracles), defect tracking, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>We shouldn't try to automate negative or failover tests since they need testers to think analytically, and negative tests aren't always easy to offer a pass or fail result that can help us.</p>\n\n<p>Who should be involved with test automation?<br>\nWith short Agile iterations, testing frequently needs a \"shift left\" strategy. Because of the shift to the left in the agile development process, testing can begin considerably earlier in the application lifetime. As a result of this strategy, developers with strong technical skills are increasingly being held responsible for testing, and they frequently collaborate with testers to design test automation frameworks. When assessing a testing solution, it's critical to find one that meets the requirements of all team members who will be involved in the testing process. Manual testers, automation engineers, and developers are among them.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#how-to-automate-your-tests\">\n  </a>\n  How to automate your tests?\n</h3>\n\n<p>If you are wondering how to start with automation testing, you can follow this easy 5 step process.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Select software or tools for testing.<br>\nAfter you've decided which test to automate, you may look at the various testing tools accessible. Consider how a tool will operate with your present software platform before selecting one, as certain tools are better suited to a specific platform. Like UI-licious is a great choice because of its framework-agnostic character and cheaper solutions than most other products out there. Not only is it easy to start, but you also don’t need to master a coding language to implement your automated testing strategy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Determine which tests should be automated.<br>\nChoose which test you wish to automate first. Manual and automated testing are used by many software engineers. Certain functionality may need to be manually tested. With UI-licious, you can get started with 0 coding knowledge.</p></li>\n<li><p>Plans, Designs, and Scripts<br>\nAfter you have chosen your tools for automation, plan the design of the framework and its features. Then you can plan automation things that are in-scope and out-of-scope. Next, you can start scripting and execution of schedules and timelines</p></li>\n<li><p>Execute your automated tests<br>\nDuring this phase, automation scripts are run. Before they may be set to run, some scripts require input test data. Once they’ve been run, they generate extensive test reports you can easily analyze and share with your team.</p></li>\n<li><p>Maintain your test scripts<br>\nThe Test Automation Maintenance Approach is a phase of automation testing that is used to see if the new features added to the software are working properly. When new automation scripts are added, they must be reviewed and maintained in order to improve the effectiveness of automation scripts with each release cycle. UI-licious makes the maintenance easier because the scripting language relies less on CSS and XPATH selectors and more on user behaviors. Indeed, with our testing solution, you are actually creating scripts that are following the user journey you want to verify.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Conclusion<br>\nTest automation allows testers to devote more time to exploratory tests, which often uncover more flaws than any automated test. Because of these and other factors, test automation can make you save time and money on all your projects.</p>\n\n<p>And so, UI-licious is there to help you out in this world of automation testing.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from being a flexible and accessible way to start test automation, UI-licious provides precise results after testing, and the reports are also very informative and helpful, especially when looking up the history of past tests. It also provides a monitoring tab where we can see how our automation is progressing. It has a very user-friendly interface, and even non-technical individuals can understand the process.</p>\n\n"

But the answer to the question is that yes, Flexbox is still an important part of CSS. </p>\n<p>In this article, I&#8217;m going to suggest a few ways to help you decide when to use Flexbox and when to use Grid as you tackle your web development projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisflexbox\">What Is Flexbox?</h2>\n<p>CSS Flexible Box Layout, or Flexbox for short, started to appear in browsers around 2012. Having binged on floats and third-party layout libraries for years, web designers and developers welcomed this new CSS module with enthusiasm, although it took a little while to get used to its alien syntax and acquire full command of its inner workings. </p>\n<p>A flex container can be defined in a CSS document like so: <code>.container {  display: flex; }</code>. Then, as the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/\">W3C Specification</a> says, its children —</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since the introduction of Flexbox, things like creating equal-length columns irrespective of their amount of content, centering elements both horizontally and vertically, lining up and spacing navigation links along a horizontal line and more, has become much easier. </p>\n<p>Wrapping columns inside a flex container is enough to achieve equal-length columns.

Let&#8217;s now move on and look at Grid.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatiscssgrid\">What Is CSS Grid?</h2>\n<p>In March 2017, CSS Grid Layout started to receive widespread browser support. According to the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/\">Grid specification</a>, Grid layout is —</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a new layout model for CSS that has powerful abilities to control the sizing and positioning of boxes and their contents. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With Grid, the power to build all kinds of robust layouts on the Web has grown immensely, so much so that Jen Simmons, CSS expert and renowned Grid advocate, has been encouraging web designers and developers to be adventurous in their layouts and break out of overly used common patterns. (See her YouTube video <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jreccgYLfx8\">Modern Layouts: Getting Out of Our Ruts</a></em>.)</p>\n<p>Thanks to Grid, it&#8217;s easy to create a complex layout that doesn&#8217;t use much code at all, needs no floats or other hacks, and that causes zero headaches. </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/full/yLXLPMa\">CodePen demo</a>. (Note that Grid only kicks in on wider screen sizes.)</p>\n<p><!-- https://codepen.io/antonietta/pen/RwVeRNd --></p>\n<p>In that demo, to create the basic grid for the entire page at full size, I turned my container <code>div</code> into a <em>grid container</em> and then divided it up into columns and rows: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.container {\r\n  display: grid; \r\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1.2fr 1.5fr;\r\n  grid-template-rows:  1fr 4fr 3fr 2fr;\r\n}    \r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>fr</code> unit is a new flexible unit of measurement introduced with CSS Grid Layout. The <code>fr</code> part is short for fractional, as it represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container. Using <code>fr</code> rather than a fixed unit like <code>px</code>, means letting the browser work out the math needed to create the layout, which I think is preferable in most cases.</p>\n<p>Once the grid is ready, it&#8217;s time to go ahead and place the child elements inside it. There are a few <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/seven-ways-you-can-place-elements-using-css-grid-layout/\">different ways</a> to do this. In the demo above, I used grid line numbers and the grid-area property, which does the job in one line of code. For example, here&#8217;s the code to lay out my main content: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.main {\r\n  /* row start, row end, col start col end */\r\n  grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 3;\r\n} \r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once all the sections are in place within the grid, here&#8217;s what it looks like: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1628089813grid-layout-blocks.png\" alt=\"Page layout using CSS Grid\" /></p>\n<p>For more details and handy cheat sheets, check out the links below: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>SitePoint&#8217;s “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/introducing-the-css-grid-layout/\">Introducing the CSS Grid Layout</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/creating-css-grid-layouts/\">Creating Layouts with CSS Grid</a>” tutorials</li>\n<li>Rachel Andrew&#8217;s <a href=\"https://gridbyexample.com/examples/\">Grid by Example</a> </li>\n<li>Jen Simmons&#8217; s <a href=\"https://labs.jensimmons.com/\">Experimental Layout Lab</a>  </li>\n<li>CSS-Tricks&#8217;s “<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/\">A Complete Guide to Grid</a>”</li>\n<li>the MDN <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout\">CSS Grid Layout Guide</a></li>\n<li>Wes Bos&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP5CIFvt9-ze3IngcdAc2xKG\">CSS Grid</a> course</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"gridorflexboxwhichoneshouldigofor\">Grid or Flexbox:  Which One Should I Go For?</h2>\n<p>Having had a taste of what both Grid and Flexbox are capable of, it&#8217;s time to go back to the original question. When is one preferable to the other?  </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a Twitter thread Chris Coyier launched a couple of years ago basically asking this same question: </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For y&#39;all that have an understand of both CSS grid and flexbox, what&#39;s your favorite way of explaining the difference?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Chris Coyier (@chriscoyier) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1088827201468813312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 25, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For y&#8217;all that have an understand of both CSS grid and flexbox, what&#8217;s your favorite way of explaining the difference?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-- https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1088827201468813312 --></p>\n<p>As you can expect, a number of interesting answers did crop up, most of which I&#8217;ve sorted out under the headings below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gridforpagelayoutandflexboxforcomponents\">Grid for page layout and Flexbox for components</h3>\n<p>“Grid for page layout and Flexbox for components” is perhaps the most intuitive answer one could give to this question. In fact, I wouldn&#8217;t have any doubts as to which technology I&#8217;d use when coding up a whole page layout. You <em>can</em> do page layouts with Flexbox — and indeed, that&#8217;s what most of us did before Grid entered the scene. But creating a grid with flexbox has never felt really “flexy” and has never come without a few headaches. Grid, on the other hand, was simply born for this. However, the question remains: was it born <em>just</em> for this?   </p>\n<p>It turns out that Grid is also great when creating components to be placed inside the macro, page-level sections. For example, in the demo below, the form is a grid container and its elements have been laid out using CSS Grid properties.  </p>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"400\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-slug-hash=\"eYRYeyE\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n<span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/eYRYeyE\"><br />\nform-with-css-grid</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br />\non <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p><script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script><br />\n<!-- https://codepen.io/antonietta/pen/ExmEZYx --></p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the <strong>Email</strong> and the <strong>Password</strong> labels are of different lengths, the form fields line up perfectly, both horizontally and vertically. And this is the magic of Grid: it lays out web element both horizontally and vertically, by default, be it page-level elements or component-level elements. This specificity that Grid possesses is a powerful factor in deciding when to use Flexbox or Grid.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/flexbox-or-grid-how-to-choose/?utm_source=rss\">Flexbox or CSS Grid?

It doesn’t necessarily have to be overly useful or practical. Instead, its true value shines in the experience you get from it. It might leave you with your jaw dropped, with a smile on your face, surprised, excited, or inspired.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, we collected lovely little sites like these, found in the remote corners of the web. They are perfect for a <strong>short coffee break</strong> or whenever you’re up for a little bit of diversion. We hope you’ll enjoy them. Oh, and if you’ve come across a website that you feel is too good to keep to yourself, please don’t hesitate to share it in the comments below. We’d love to hear about it!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"plant-guides-from-a-to-z\">Plant Guides, From A To Z</h2>\n\n<p>Every office, and that includes home office as well, is better off with a lovely selection of beautiful plants.

They are witnesses of their time and, when we look at old maps, it’s like taking a trip back into long forgotten days. Now imagine that you had a magic spyglass that could show you what your neighborhood looked like 100 years ago. You’d only need to get out a recent map, hover your spyglass over it, and see what has changed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"\n  \n    break-out article__image\n  \n  \n  \">\n  \n    <a href=\"http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/spy/index.cfm#zoom=16.609999999999985&amp;lat=51.4838&amp;lon=-0.1238&amp;layers=168&amp;b=1\">\n    \n    <img\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      decoding=\"async\"\n      importance=\"low\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"800\"\n\t\t\theight=\"477\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsrcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/74a5a24f-5aab-4738-b2fc-1006225dbaac/historic-maps-opt.png 400w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/74a5a24f-5aab-4738-b2fc-1006225dbaac/historic-maps-opt.png 800w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/74a5a24f-5aab-4738-b2fc-1006225dbaac/historic-maps-opt.png 1200w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/74a5a24f-5aab-4738-b2fc-1006225dbaac/historic-maps-opt.png 1600w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/74a5a24f-5aab-4738-b2fc-1006225dbaac/historic-maps-opt.png 2000w\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/74a5a24f-5aab-4738-b2fc-1006225dbaac/historic-maps-opt.png\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsizes=\"100vw\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Georeferenced Map\"\n\t\t/>\n    \n    </a>\n  \n\n  \n    <figcaption class=\"op-vertical-bottom\">\n      (Image credit: <a href='http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/spy/index.cfm#zoom=16.609999999999985&lat=51.4838&lon=-0.1238&layers=168&b=1'>National Library of Scotland</a>)\n    </figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n\n<p>Well, actually, that’s possible.

The little game created by the folks at the UX design and web development studio Supremo takes your design eye to the ultimate test: You’re presented with shapes and need to decide if the dot is placed in the center.

I like <a href=\"https://samuelkraft.com/blog/fractional-svg-stars-css\">this idea</a> by Samuel Kraft. The tricky part is:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>The final step is making the overlay div only affect the star SVGs beneath, not the background. We can do this by using the CSS&nbsp;<code>mix-blend-mode</code>&nbsp;property with the&nbsp;<code>color</code>&nbsp;value.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out Samuel&#8217;s post for an interactive demo and deeper information, but I thought I&#8217;d give it a crack myself to get a feel for the idea:</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-358210\"></span>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_poWvyXQ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/poWvyXQ?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=poWvyXQ&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed poWvyXQ\" title=\"CodePen Embed poWvyXQ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that this is an overlay on top of the stars. You can&#8217;t see it and it doesn&#8217;t affect the stars because it&#8217;s either <code>black</code> or <code>white</code> and <code>mix-blend-mode: color;</code> means that overlay will only effect elements that do have color. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are loads of ways to do rating stars, for the record. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/five-methods-for-five-star-ratings/#method-5-using-unicode-symbols\">We covered five of them</a> a little while back. One rather clever method in there is using unicode stars (like, as text), then filling their background with <code>-webkit-background-clip: text;</code> which means you can partially fill them (like with a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/hard-stop-gradients/\">hard-stop</a> <code>linear-gradient()</code>). Solid trickery, that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samuelkraft.com/blog/fractional-svg-stars-css\">To Shared Link</a> &#8212; <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/fractional-svg-stars-with-css/\">Permalink on CSS-Tricks</a></p>"

days across weeks.</strong> In every session, there is always enough time to bring up your questions or just get a cup of tea. We don’t rush through the content, but instead, try to create a welcoming, <strong>friendly and inclusive environment for everyone</strong> to have time to think, discuss and get feedback.</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/smashing-workshop-form-design-masterclass/\">things to expect from a Smashing workshop</a>, but the most important one is focusing on practical examples and techniques. The workshops aren’t talks; they are interactive, with live conversations with attendees, sometimes with challenges, homework and team work. Of course, you get all workshop materials and <strong>video recordings</strong> as well, so if you miss a session you can re-watch it the same day.</p>\n\n<div class=\"btn--lined btn--lined--white-border mt0\"><a class=\"btn btn--large btn--green btn--text-shadow\" href=\"https://www.smashingconf.com/online-workshops/\">Jump to all workshops →</a></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"smashingconf-san-francisco-2022\">SmashingConf San Francisco 2022</h2>\n\n<p>Yes, it’s official!

In this article, we&#8217;ll develop a task management tool whose data is fetched from Airtable. We&#8217;ll use React for the front end, with a hybrid rendering strategy.</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a common scenario: you want to develop an app that connects to data from a spreadsheet application or some other data source. In this article, I&#8217;ll show you how to implement an application of this type with the Gatsby framework. In our example application, tasks will be imported from an Airtable workspace and visualized as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart\">Gantt chart</a>. The user can move the tasks by drag and drop, after which all changes will be synchronized with Airtable. You can use the project as a template for all kinds of scheduling apps.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636866638task-table.png\" alt=\"A simple task table\" /></p>\n<p>You can try the result live on my <a href=\"https://ganttchartgatsbymain.gatsbyjs.io/\">Gatsby Cloud site</a>. The src files of the project can be found in my <a href=\"https://github.com/aprenzel/gantt-chart-gatsby-public\">GitHub repository</a>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"settinguptheproject\">Setting Up the Project</h2>\n<p>Gatsby is a static site generator. This means you write your application with React, and Gatsby translates your code into HTML files that are understandable to the browser. This build process is carried out at regular intervals on the <strong>server side</strong>, in contrast to conventional web applications where the HTML code is first assembled on the client side in the user&#8217;s browser. The HTML files are therefore statically available on the server (hence the name static site generator) and can be sent directly to the client when requested. This reduces the loading time of the application for the user.</p>\n<p>SitePoint&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/gatsby-guide/\">Gatsby tutorial</a> provides all the information you need to develop an application with this framework. If you want to develop my example application step by step, you should start as outlines below.</p>\n<p>First, you should download and install <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">Node.js</a>. You can check if it&#8217;s installed correctly by typing <code>node -v</code> on the console. The current version of Node should be displayed:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">node -v\r\n&gt; v14.16.0\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>With Node we also get npm, the Node package manager. With this tool, we can now install the Gatsby CLI:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install -g gatsby-cli\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re ready to create a new project using the Gatsby CLI. I name it &#8220;gantt-chart-gatsby&#8221;:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">gatsby new gantt-chart-gatsby\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then move into the project folder with the command <code>cd gantt-chart-gatsby</code> and build the project with the command <code>gatsby develop</code>. Now you can open the index page of the project in the browser on <a href=\"http://localhost:8000\">http://localhost:8000</a>. At first, you should only see the welcome page that Gatsby has prepared for us.</p>\n<p>In the next step, you should examine the <code>src</code> folder of the project. The subfolder <code>src/pages</code> contains the React components of the individual pages of the project. For now, it&#8217;s sufficient for you to keep the <code>index.js</code> file for the index page, because, in our example application, we only need one page. You can delete the other files in this folder, except for <code>404.js</code> (which can be useful if someone enters a wrong address).</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good starting point if you overwrite the existing code in <code>index.js</code> with this code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import * as React from 'react'\r\n\r\nconst IndexPage = () =&gt; {\r\n  return (\r\n   &lt;main&gt;\r\n      &lt;title&gt;Gantt Chart&lt;/title&gt;\r\n      &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my Gatsby Gantt Chart&lt;/h1&gt; \r\n\r\n    &lt;/main&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default IndexPage;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can build the project again with the command <code>gatsby develop</code> on the command line and open the index page in the browser. Now you should see an empty page with the heading &#8220;Welcome to my Gatsby Gantt Chart&#8221;.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildingthefrontendwithreact\">Building the Front End with React</h2>\n<h3 id=\"thefirstversionoftheindexpage\">The first version of the index page</h3>\n<p>We will implement the Gantt chart as a reusable React component. Before I explain the implementation of the component in detail in the following sections, I&#8217;d first like to show how it&#8217;s initialized and embedded in the index page. So I&#8217;d recommend you to hold off using the <code>gatsby develop</code> command until we&#8217;ve finished the first version of the component. (I&#8217;ll let you know when we&#8217;re ready!)</p>\n<p>In this example project, I use the concept of &#8220;jobs&#8221; and &#8220;resources&#8221;. <strong>Jobs</strong> are the tasks that are drawn into the chart cells and that can be moved by drag and drop. <strong>Resources</strong> contain the labels for the rows in which the jobs can be moved. These can be names for the tasks, but in other use cases also the names of people, vehicles or machines carrying out the tasks. </p>\n<p>Jobs and resources are passed to the Gantt chart component as properties. Before connecting the task management tool to Airtable, we fill the lists with some hard-coded test data in JSON format: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import * as React from \"react\";\r\nimport {GanttChart} from \"../GanttChart\";\r\nimport \"../styles/index.css\";\r\n\r\nlet j = [\r\n  {id: \"j1\", start: new Date(\"2021/6/1\"), end: new Date(\"2021/6/4\"), resource: \"r1\"},\r\n  {id: \"j2\", start: new Date(\"2021/6/4\"), end: new Date(\"2021/6/13\"), resource: \"r2\"},\r\n  {id: \"j3\", start: new Date(\"2021/6/13\"), end: new Date(\"2021/6/21\"), resource: \"r3\"},\r\n];\r\n\r\nlet r = [{id:\"r1\", name: \"Task 1\"}, {id:\"r2\", name: \"Task 2\"}, {id:\"r3\", name: \"Task 3\"}, {id:\"r4\", name: \"Task 4\"}];\r\n\r\nconst IndexPage = () =&gt; {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;main&gt;\r\n      &lt;title&gt;Gantt Chart&lt;/title&gt;\r\n      &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my Gatsby Gantt Chart&lt;/h1&gt; \r\n      &lt;GanttChart jobs={j} resources={r}/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/main&gt;\r\n  )\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default IndexPage;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"cssstylesfortheganttchart\">CSS styles for the Gantt chart</h3>\n<p>In the next step, we create a new <code>index.css</code> file in the <code>styles</code> folder. (If the folder doesn&#8217;t exist, create a new folder <code>styles</code> in the folder <code>src</code> of the project.) The following CSS settings control the layout and appearance of the Gantt chart:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">body{\r\n  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#gantt-container{\r\n  display: grid;     \r\n}\r\n\r\n.gantt-row-resource{\r\n  background-color:whitesmoke;\r\n  color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.726);\r\n  border:1px solid rgb(133, 129, 129);\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n  padding: 15px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.gantt-row-period{\r\n  background-color:whitesmoke;\r\n  color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.726);\r\n  border:1px solid rgb(133, 129, 129);\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n\r\n  display:grid;\r\n  grid-auto-flow: column;\r\n  grid-auto-columns: minmax(40px, 1fr);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.period{\r\n  padding: 10px 0 10px 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.gantt-row-item{\r\n  border: 1px solid rgb(214, 214, 214);\r\n  padding: 10px 0 10px 0;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  background-color:white;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.job{\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  height:38px;\r\n  top:5px;\r\n  z-index: 100;\r\n  background-color:rgb(167, 171, 245);\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"implementingtheganttchartcomponent\">Implementing the <code>GanttChart</code> component</h3>\n<p>Now I&#8217;ll explain the implementation of the <code>GanttChart</code> component in more detail. First, we need a file named <code>GanttChart.js</code> in the <code>src</code> folder. In this tutorial, I use a simplified version of the <code>GanttChart</code> for only one month (June 2021). An extended version with select fields for starting month and end month can be found at GitHub under the name <a href=\"https://github.com/aprenzel/gantt-chart-gatsby-public/blob/main/src/GanttChart_extended.js\">GanttChart_extended.js</a>.</p>\n<p>The chart table is built up in three steps, represented by the functions <code>initFirstRow</code>, <code>initSecondRow</code> and <code>initGanttRows</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport class GanttChart extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n    names = [\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\"];\r\n\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n\r\n        super(props);       \r\n\r\n        this.state = {\r\n            dateFrom: new Date(2021,5,1),\r\n            dateTo: new Date(2021,5,30),\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n\r\n        let month = new Date(this.state.dateFrom.getFullYear(), this.state.dateFrom.getMonth(), 1);\r\n\r\n        let grid_style = \"100px 1fr\";\r\n\r\n        let firstRow = this.initFirstRow(month);\r\n        let secondRow = this.initSecondRow(month);\r\n        let ganttRows = this.initGanttRows(month);\r\n\r\n        return (\r\n\r\n            &lt;div className=\"gantt-chart\"&gt;\r\n                &lt;div id=\"gantt-container\" style={{gridTemplateColumns : grid_style}}&gt;\r\n                    {firstRow}\r\n                    {secondRow}\r\n                    {ganttRows}\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        );\r\n     }\r\n\r\n\r\n    initFirstRow(month){...}\r\n\r\n    initSecondRow(month){...}\r\n\r\n    initGanttRows(month){...}\r\n\r\n\r\n    //helper functions:\r\n\r\n    formatDate(d){ \r\n        return d.getFullYear()+\"-\"+this.zeroPad(d.getMonth()+1)+\"-\"+this.zeroPad(d.getDate());  \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    zeroPad(n){\r\n        return n&lt;10 ? \"0\"+n : n;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    monthDiff(d1, d2) {\r\n        let months;\r\n        months = (d2.getFullYear() - d1.getFullYear()) * 12;\r\n        months -= d1.getMonth();\r\n        months += d2.getMonth();\r\n        return months &lt;= 0 ? 0 : months;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    dayDiff(d1, d2){   \r\n        let diffTime = Math.abs(d2 - d1);\r\n        let diffDays = Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)); \r\n        return diffDays;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the <code>initFirstRow</code> function, the first row of the chart table is generated. As you can see from the picture above, the first row consists of two grid cells. These are generated as divs, which in turn are inserted as children into the &#8220;gantt-container&#8221; (see the listing above). The second div also contains the label for the current month. </p>\n<p>React requires a unique &#8220;key&#8221; property for all elements that are part of an enumeration. This helps to optimize the rendering performance:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\"> initFirstRow(month){\r\n\r\n    let elements = []; let i = 0;\r\n\r\n    elements.push(&lt;div key={\"fr\"+(i++)} className=\"gantt-row-resource\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;);\r\n\r\n    elements.push(&lt;div key={\"fr\"+(i++)} className=\"gantt-row-period\"&gt;&lt;div className=\"period\"&gt;{this.names[month.getMonth()] + \" \" + month.getFullYear()}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;);\r\n\r\n    return elements;\r\n }\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The next row of the chart table is generated in the <code>initSecondRow</code> function. We use the same principle again: for each table cell, a div is created. You have to make sure that the divs are nested correctly (the second div in the row contains individual divs for each day of the month) so that the CSS Grid settings (see the <code>index.css</code> file) will produce the desired layout:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">initSecondRow(month){\r\n\r\n    let elements = []; let i=0;\r\n\r\n    //first div\r\n    elements.push(&lt;div key={\"sr\"+(i++)} style={{borderTop : 'none'}} className=\"gantt-row-resource\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;);\r\n\r\n    let days = [];\r\n\r\n    let f_om = new Date(month); //first day of month\r\n    let l_om = new Date(month.getFullYear(), month.getMonth()+1, 0); //last day of month\r\n\r\n    let date = new Date(f_om);\r\n\r\n    for(date; date &lt;= l_om; date.setDate(date.getDate()+1)){\r\n\r\n        days.push(&lt;div key={\"sr\"+(i++)} style={{borderTop: 'none'}} className=\"gantt-row-period period\"&gt;{date.getDate()}&lt;/div&gt;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //second div in the row with child divs for the individual days\r\n    elements.push(&lt;div key={\"sr\"+(i++)} style={{border: 'none'}} className=\"gantt-row-period\"&gt;{days}&lt;/div&gt;);\r\n\r\n    return elements;\r\n\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The remaining rows of the chart table are generated in the <code>initGanttRows</code> function. They contain the grid cells into which the jobs are drawn. Again, the rendering is done row by row: for each row we first place the name of the resource, then we iterate over the individual days of the month. Each grid cell is initialized as a <code>ChartCell</code> component for a specific day and resource. With the <code>cell_jobs</code> list, the individual cell is assigned the jobs that need to be drawn into it (typically this is exactly one job):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">initGanttRows(month){\r\n\r\n    let elements = []; let i=0;\r\n\r\n    this.props.resources.forEach(resource =&gt; {\r\n\r\n        elements.push(&lt;div key={\"gr\"+(i++)} style={{borderTop : 'none'}} className=\"gantt-row-resource\"&gt;{resource.name}&lt;/div&gt;);\r\n\r\n        let cells = [];\r\n\r\n        let f_om = new Date(month);\r\n        let l_om = new Date(month.getFullYear(), month.getMonth()+1, 0);\r\n\r\n        let date = new Date(f_om);\r\n\r\n        for(date; date &lt;= l_om; date.setDate(date.getDate()+1)){\r\n\r\n            let cell_jobs = this.props.jobs.filter((job) =&gt; job.resource == resource.id &amp;&amp; job.start.getTime() == date.getTime());\r\n\r\n            cells.push(&lt;ChartCell key={\"gr\"+(i++)} resource={resource} date={new Date(date)} jobs={cell_jobs}/&gt;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        elements.push(&lt;div key={\"gr\"+(i++)} style={{border: 'none'}} className=\"gantt-row-period\"&gt;{cells}&lt;/div&gt;);\r\n\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return elements;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now add the following code for the <code>ChartCell</code> component at the end of <code>GanttChart.js</code>. The component renders a single table cell of the chart as a div containing one or more jobs as child elements. The HTML code for displaying a job is provided by the <code>getJobElement</code> function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">class ChartCell extends React.Component {\r\n\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n\r\n      super(props);\r\n\r\n      this.state = {\r\n        jobs: props.jobs\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n\r\n      let jobElements = this.props.jobs.map((job) =&gt; this.getJobElement(job));\r\n\r\n      return (\r\n        &lt;div \r\n            style={{borderTop: 'none', borderRight: 'none', backgroundColor: (this.props.date.getDay()==0 || this.props.date.getDay()==6) ? \"whitesmoke\" : \"white\" }} \r\n            className=\"gantt-row-item\"&gt;\r\n            {jobElements}\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    getJobElement(job){\r\n\r\n        let d = this.dayDiff(job.start, job.end);\r\n\r\n        //Example: a job with a duration of 2 days covers exactly two grid cells, so the width is 2*100% and we have to add up 2px for the width of the grid lines\r\n        return (\r\n        &lt;div    style={{width: \"calc(\"+(d*100)+\"% + \"+ d + \"px)\"}} \r\n                className=\"job\" \r\n                id={job.id} \r\n                key={job.id}\r\n        &gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    dayDiff(d1, d2){   \r\n        let diffTime = Math.abs(d2 - d1);\r\n        let diffDays = Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)); \r\n        return diffDays;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point, you can build the project from the root folder using the <code>gatsby develop</code> command. The hard-coded jobs from the index page should be visible in the Gantt chart. They can&#8217;t be dragged and dropped yet, but we&#8217;ll take care of that later.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-interactive-gantt-charts-with-airtable-gatsby-and-react/?utm_source=rss\">Build Interactive Gantt Charts with Airtable, Gatsby and React</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Back in my developer days, I worked as a freelance developer to expand my skillset and knowledge, and since becoming an engineering manager, I&#8217;ve hired freelance developers for the companies I worked for.</strong> </p>\n<p>In this article, I want to share my insights around hiring freelance developers, and best practices to finding and hiring the best freelance developers in the gig economy. As engineering leaders, it&#8217;s important to understand and take advantage of the gig economy, as it has emerged as one of the most significant developments in the way we work. The outsourced workforce is going to be part of the future of work, whether you like it or not. </p>\n<h2 id=\"hiringafreelancedeveloper\">Hiring a Freelance Developer</h2>\n<p>When should you hire a freelance developer? If you haven&#8217;t hired freelance developers before, you might be asking why you need them. These are some common reasons companies hire freelancers: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Access to a variety of skills</strong>, across different tech stacks and niche — such as iOS mobile development, ecommerce website development, and so on.</li>\n<li>Freelance developers are more readily available. Developers who are freelancers are usually available within weeks. </li>\n<li><strong>Freelance developers are more affordable</strong>. Even if their hourly rate may be higher in some cases, compared to having a permanent developer, it&#8217;s going to end up more affordable, as there won&#8217;t be extra spending like insurance, 401k or superannuation. </li>\n<li><strong>You may not need a long-term, permanent developer</strong>. A company may decide that there&#8217;s a project that can be done once and won&#8217;t require continuous maintenance or work. Or there might be a project that requires a specific skill for a specific milestone — such as setting up DevOps infrastructure, refactoring an old tech stack to a new one, redesigning a UI for a web application, small bug fixes, and so on. </li>\n<li><strong>You have a distributed team</strong>. This has grown in relevance over the past year, with a large rise in remote work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Importantly, evidence suggests that affordability is at the top of the list for smaller companies, even if they&#8217;re not a fully distributed team. </p>\n<h2 id=\"whennottohireafreelancedeveloper\">When Not to Hire a Freelance Developer</h2>\n<p>Hiring freelance developers may not be the right move, for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may prefer to work with people in the same office/timezone. Data shows that there&#8217;s a large population of freelance developers in Eastern Europe and North America, followed by Asia and Middle East.</li>\n<li>You may not have confidence in the skills and/or quality of freelancers.</li>\n<li>There may be intellectual property and security issues.</li>\n<li>Using freelancers may have a negative impact on the potential value of the company for startups trying to get funding.</li>\n<li>For startups trying to get funding, using freelancers may have a negative impact on the perceived value of the company.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"importantfactorstotakeintoconsiderationwhenhiringfreelancedevelopers\">Important Factors to Take into Consideration when Hiring Freelance Developers</h2>\n<p>There are multiple important factors to take into consideration when hiring freelance developers. Understanding and applying these best practices is crucial to producing successful outcomes for a company employing a freelance workforce. Therefore, to be successful, engineering leaders need to think holistically to bring the organization and technology together as closely as possible in decision making. </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/hire-best-freelance-developers/?utm_source=rss\">How to Hire the Best Freelance Developers in the Gig Economy</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

A video includes motion, music, still images, text, speech, and a few other elements, all of which combine to deliver engagement like never before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTKDEKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTTNIZP7UN4B3JVMJD553J227I5ASVCQFCASIMPQKE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">research</a>, users spend 88% more time on a website with videos, and video content receives 1200% more shares than images or text. This is corroborated by the trend we see on key social media platforms, with businesses on these platforms now preferring video content over still images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When streaming videos on one&#8217;s website or app, hosting a video on a platform like YouTube might not be a viable option. This is especially true if you want to present a native-looking user experience and control it, or you do not want to share revenues with a third party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In such cases, cloud providers like AWS become the go-to choice for hosting and streaming videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-357012\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-streaming-optimized-videos-from-s3-current-methods-and-drawbacks\">Streaming optimized videos from S3 — current methods and drawbacks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A typical setup includes hosting the videos on AWS S3, the most popular cloud object storage around, and then directly streaming them on the users&#8217; device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For an even better video load time, you can use AWS CloudFront CDN with your S3 bucket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"587\" height=\"161\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LvfDlzupRh9eQGGI.webp?resize=587%2C161&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-357013\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LvfDlzupRh9eQGGI.webp?w=587&amp;ssl=1 587w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LvfDlzupRh9eQGGI.webp?resize=300%2C82&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Typical video streaming setup with AWS S3 and CloudFront CDN without any video optimizations</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, given that the original videos are often massive in size and that neither S3 nor CloudFront have built-in video optimization capabilities, this is far from ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, the video streaming is slow and results in unnecessary waste of bandwidth, lower average video playback time, and lower user retention and revenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To solve this, we need to optimize videos for different devices, network speeds, and our website or app layout before streaming from the S3 storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you could use a solution like <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTKHEKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTTESI5HSFVNI3ZQMHT7ZD2MKILSBVV2WUW2I3C2VT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">AWS Elemental MediaConvert</a> for all kinds of transcoding and optimizations, such solutions often have a steep learning curve and often become very complex to manage. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>You need to understand how to set up these tools with your existing workflow and storage, understand job creation in these tools, and manage job queues and job completion notifications in your workflow.</li><li>To create MediaConvert jobs, you would have to understand different streaming protocols, encoding, formats, resolution, codecs, etc., for video streaming and map them to your requirements to build the right jobs.</li><li>AWS MediaConvert is not an on-the-fly video conversion tool in itself. You need to pair it with other AWS services to make it work in real-time, making the setup even more complex and expensive. If you do not opt for on-the-fly video conversion, you need to configure MediaConvert&#8217;s jobs correctly from the go. Any new requirement will require the job to be changed and re-run on all videos to generate a new encoding or format.

To do this, you would need to use the S3 bucket&#8217;s domain name as the base URL for this origin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, ensure that you map the S3 bucket to a URL endpoint in the ImageKit dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it!

Video Streaming from S3 using ImageKit URLs</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With your S3 bucket now attached to ImageKit, you can now access any video file in your bucket via ImageKit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, we have the video sample.mp4 in our test bucket at the key videos/woman-walking.mp4. We can access it with ImageKit using the <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTKMEKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTT5DG5JDMCKQLQ2ZUVSPPV7K66L4YKHDCVJ4D5QPT\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">following URL</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">https://ik.imagekit.io/ikmedia/videos/woman-walking.mp4</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>When we open this URL in a browser tab, the browser will stream the video via ImageKit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/ikmedia/videos/woman-walking.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We can now use this URL in a &lt;video&gt; tag to stream videos on our web page.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">&lt;video src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/ikmedia/videos/woman-walking.mp4\" controls>&lt;/video></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And because ImageKit comes integrated with AWS CloudFront CDN, your videos will get delivered in milliseconds to your users, thereby improving the overall streaming experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-using-video-optimizations-and-transformations-with-s3-streaming\">Using video optimizations and transformations with S3 streaming</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have seen how to stream videos from S3 using ImageKit on our apps. However, as mentioned earlier in the article, we need to optimize videos for different devices, website layout, and other conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ImageKit helps us there as well. It can optimize and scale your videos or encode them to different formats in real-time. In addition, ImageKit makes most of the necessary optimizations automatically, using the best defaults, or exposes the functionalities as easy-to-use URL parameters that work in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, unlike the other tools like AWS MediaConvert, there is minimal learning you need to do. And you definitely won&#8217;t have to learn the nuances of video streaming and encoding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at the video optimizations and transformations ImageKit is capable of, apart from direct streaming of videos from S3.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Automatic conversion to best format while streaming</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>ImageKit automatically identifies the video formats supported in browsers and combines them with the original video information to encode it to the best possible output format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTKUEKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTTADYVRWCNRS4KMPDLWLLCMZF6JSN2Q3HL2SEZ6AE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">video format optimization</a> is done in real-time when you request your S3 video via ImageKit and results in a smaller video size sent to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enable this <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTK7EKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTTRDJ2QUIPJS7KQ4WCJLZ22S6KEPYCMJDLRILV2BT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">automatic format conversion</a>, you have to enable the corresponding setting in your ImageKit dashboard. No complex setup, no configurations needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, after enabling the above setting, an MP4 video gets delivered in WebM format in Chrome and MP4 in Safari.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1583\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eifNvg6qffsjJR1C-1.jpeg?resize=1583%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-357019\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eifNvg6qffsjJR1C-1.jpeg?w=1583&amp;ssl=1 1583w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eifNvg6qffsjJR1C-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C152&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eifNvg6qffsjJR1C-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C517&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eifNvg6qffsjJR1C-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C388&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eifNvg6qffsjJR1C-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C776&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/eifNvg6qffsjJR1C-1.jpeg?resize=1000%2C505&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Same video delivered in WebM format in Chrome browser</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. Automatic compression of videos while streaming</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern cameras capture videos that can easily run into a few 100MBs, if not GBs. It is not ideal to deliver such large video files to your users. It will take them ages to stream the video, results in a poor user experience, and impact your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, we need to compress the video to deliver it quickly to our users. However, we need to do so while maintaining the visual quality of the video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is again something ImageKit does for you automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can turn on the corresponding setting from the ImageKit dashboard and set the default compression level for your videos. By default, this value would be 50, which strikes a good balance between output size and visual quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6nTINPeXRgScSNaT.jpeg?resize=1024%2C506&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-357020\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6nTINPeXRgScSNaT.jpeg?resize=1024%2C506&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6nTINPeXRgScSNaT.jpeg?resize=300%2C148&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6nTINPeXRgScSNaT.jpeg?resize=768%2C379&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6nTINPeXRgScSNaT.jpeg?resize=1536%2C758&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6nTINPeXRgScSNaT.jpeg?resize=1000%2C494&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6nTINPeXRgScSNaT.jpeg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Turning on automatic quality optimization in the dashboard</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After enabling this setting, ImageKit will <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTKSEKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTTMZ3GQVD4OPHG3SFLO4JP2BIVMPU2RVMW7IYPQSE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">encode your video at the specified compression level</a> before streaming it to the user&#8217;s device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the compression, though the following video has the same format as its original video, it is lighter by almost 15% at 12.6MB compared to the original video at 14.6MB.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Using real-time video compression for slow network users</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As explained with examples later in this article, ImageKit allows you to <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTKREKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTTLSQZ3WN52D3CHYCL2B4ZQKHLID7GQJCKEJIKVYE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">transform videos in real-time</a>. One of the real-time URL transformations possible in ImageKit is to modify the compression level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transformation allows us to override the default compression level selected in the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video below, for example, is compressed to a quality level of 30 and is almost 70% smaller than the video we encoded using the default quality level of 50 set in the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/ikmedia/videos/woman-walking.mp4?tr=f-mp4,q-30\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HbeWjXXTRUXYwrSH.jpeg?resize=1500%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-357021\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HbeWjXXTRUXYwrSH.jpeg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HbeWjXXTRUXYwrSH.jpeg?resize=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HbeWjXXTRUXYwrSH.jpeg?resize=1024%2C546&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HbeWjXXTRUXYwrSH.jpeg?resize=768%2C410&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HbeWjXXTRUXYwrSH.jpeg?resize=1000%2C533&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This real-time compression-level transformation allows us to adapt our videos to users on slow networks.<br><br>For example, if someone is experiencing poor network conditions, you can stream a more compressed, lighter video to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Scaling S3 videos in real-time while streaming</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you want to load a video on your page and have only a 200px width available for your content. The resolution of the original video you have, almost always, would be a lot higher than this size. Loading anything significantly larger than the size you require is a waste of bandwidth and offers no benefit to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With ImageKit, you can <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTD3EKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTT2ZVGHL6CIIE52VDV5ZH5V7IL2Z35MFDLLDDQMHE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">scale the video to any size in real-time</a> before streaming it on the device. Just like its real-time image transformation API, you can add a width or height parameter to the URL, and you will get a video with the required dimensions in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, we have scaled down our video to a width of 200px using the <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTDDEKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTTODHPJZNWWBD22IIP7BP52ZC45D4K67HC7B5CW7E\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">URL given below</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">https://ik.imagekit.io/ikmedia/videos/woman-walking.mp4?tr=w-200</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/ikmedia/videos/woman-walking.mp4?tr=w-200\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. Adapting videos to different placeholders and creating vertical videos</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We often shoot videos in landscape mode, i.e., the video&#8217;s width is greater than its height. However, you would often require a portrait or vertical video where the height is greater than the video&#8217;s width.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A very common use case would be converting your landscape video to a vertical one like an Instagram story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ImageKit makes it super simple with its <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTDHEKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTTLSQZ3WN52D3CHYCL2B4ZQKHLID7GQJCKEJIKVYE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">real-time video transformations</a>. You can add the width and height parameters to <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTDFEKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTTSZZP2CFCLI6V2K6VJ4ZQ2Z6AMBP2RCU6RZQ22KT\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">the video URL</a> and get the output video in the requested size.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-none\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">https://ik.imagekit.io/ikmedia/videos/woman-walking.mp4?tr=w-300,h-500</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/ikmedia/videos/woman-walking.mp4?tr=w-300,h-500\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ImageKit streams the video in the most suitable format and at the right compression level for all the transformations above. The video is delivered via its integrated AWS CloudFront CDN for a fast load time.<br><br>For the demo video used in this article, we started with a 14.6MB original video, but after all the optimizations and scaling it down, we were able to bring down the size to 1.8MB in the last example of the vertical video.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-signup-with-imagekit-for-s3-video-streaming-for-free\">Signup with ImageKit for S3 video streaming for free</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ImageKit offers a <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TFDT7HI3TTTTTTDKCCVC4TTTTTTDQEKJK6TTTTTTN4JQKYVTTTTTTILKPQKH6WS3G3CI55PLVASDLIP5Q7PC5NDJQTBE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">Forever Free plan</a> that includes video delivery as well as processing.

I&#8217;ll make recommendations based on what you&#8217;re most likely to need.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"preinstalledrubyisnotfordevelopers\">Pre-installed Ruby is Not for Developers</h2>\n<p>Folks who are new to Ruby are delighted to discover that Ruby comes pre-installed on macOS. They&#8217;re often disappointed when a more experienced developer tells them, &#8220;Don&#8217;t use the Mac system Ruby.&#8221; I&#8217;ve written <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-not-use-mac-system-ruby-do-this-instead/\">elsewhere</a> about the reasons. In short, the system Ruby is there for macOS, not for you. It&#8217;s fine for running utility scripts, but for development, the system Ruby is out of date and, if you&#8217;re not careful, installation of gems can lead to headaches (including system security violations).</p>\n<h2 id=\"homebrewsonerubyproblem\">Homebrew&#8217;s One Ruby Problem</h2>\n<p>Homebrew is the package manager that has become a near-standard for adding developer software to macOS. Homebrew makes it easy to install a new Ruby version to avoid relying on the system Ruby. But there are two problems with Homebrew. First, Homebrew&#8217;s Ruby version can be automatically and unexpectedly replaced by a newer version when other Homebrew packages are installed (a problem solved by <code>brew pin ruby</code>). More importantly, Homebrew only lets you install one version of Ruby. If you&#8217;re developing or maintaining more than one project in Ruby, you&#8217;ll likely need to switch among Ruby versions. That&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll need a version manager.</p>\n<h2 id=\"asdfformultiplelanguages\">Asdf for Multiple Languages</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf\">Asdf</a> is a version manager that accommodates multiple languages. If you&#8217;re using Ruby to develop web applications with Rails 6, you&#8217;ll need to install Node and Yarn to build a Rails starter application. (Rails 7 may eliminate the need for Node, but that&#8217;s not yet certain at this time.) </p>\n<p>So, for a Rails developer, Asdf is an ideal version manager. It will also serve you well if you develop applications in Python, Elixir, or many other languages (see a <a href=\"https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-all\">list of supported languages</a>). Is there a downside to using Asdf? Just two. It uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)\">shims</a> to intercept common commands, which can make troubleshooting difficult. Also, it can be a little slow for some operations. If you&#8217;re developing in multiple languages, I recommend you try Asdf to see if you like it. Switch to Frum, the Ruby-only version manager written in Rust, if you find Asdf slows you down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rubyonlyversionmanagers\">Ruby-only Version Managers</h2>\n<p>If you only intend to develop applications using Ruby, choose among the four Ruby-only version managers: Chruby, Frum, Rbenv, and RVM. Differences among the four lie in speed, complexity, and how each switches Ruby versions. Let&#8217;s look at the oldest first: RVM.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rvm\">RVM</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://rvm.io/\">RVM</a> was the first popular version manager for Ruby. It&#8217;s still maintained and widely used. RVM modifies the system <code>cd</code> command to set environment variables when you change directories. To override the <code>cd</code> command, the RVM installation script changes the shell configuration file (the <code>~/.zshrc</code> file on newer Macs). </p>\n<p>RVM properly displays environment variables to reveal the Ruby and gem version and location, which can help diagnose problems. However, RVM includes additional features such as gemsets. Gemsets are no longer needed, since Bundler was added to the core Ruby to manage gem dependencies. The additional complexity isn&#8217;t needed, so many developers have switched to a newer version manager such as Rbenv, Chruby, or Frum.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/ruby-version-managers-macos/?utm_source=rss\">A Comparison of Ruby Version Managers for macOS</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

            "\n<p>I think if you&#8217;re a DevOps person in any capacity, the utility of <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a> is very clear. Your things run in containers that are identical everywhere. Assuming Docker is working/running, the code will execute in a reliably consistent way whether that is Docker running on some developer&#8217;s computer, or a sky computer. The (massive) appeal there is that bugs will happen consistently. &#8220;Production-only&#8221; bugs become a thing of the past. There are other benefits, too, like shipping a dev environment to a team of developers that is entirely consistent, even across platforms, rather than battling with individual developers computers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&#8230; great? Use it all the time for everything? The stopper there is that it&#8217;s complicated, and web dev is already friggin complicated and it often just feels like <em>too much</em>. Andrew Welch, however, makes the case that you don&#8217;t have to learn Docker super deeply in order to use it:</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-357985\"></span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>Dock­er&nbsp;is a&nbsp;devops tool that some peo­ple find intim­i­dat­ing because there is much to learn in order to build things with&nbsp;it. And while that’s true, it’s actu­al­ly quite sim­ple to start using Dock­er for some very prac­ti­cal and use­ful things, by lever­ag­ing what oth­er peo­ple have created.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Fair point. I don&#8217;t deeply understand <em>most</em> of the technology I use, but I can still use it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I run Docker all day for CodePen&#8217;s fancy dev environment, that&#8217;s what my use is limited to. I don&#8217;t reach for it like Andrew does for everything. But I can see how it might feel liberating having all that isolation between projects. One of my favorite of points that Andrew makes is:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p><strong>Switch­ing to a&nbsp;new com­put­er is easy</strong>. You don’t have to spend hours metic­u­lous­ly recon­fig­ur­ing your shiny new Mac­Book Pro with all the inter­con­nect­ed tools&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;pack­ages you&nbsp;need.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I find myself bopping around between computers fairly often for various odd reasons, and being able to make the switch with minimal fussing around is appealing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nystudio107.com/blog/dock-life-using-docker-for-all-the-things\">To Shared Link</a> &#8212; <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/dock-life-using-docker-for-all-the-things/\">Permalink on CSS-Tricks</a></p>"

It can cause difficulties with reading, writing, and spelling, though the degree of impairment varies widely &mdash; some people are barely affected while others require a great deal of extra support.</p>\n\n<p>Existing best practices and guidance, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), give us a solid foundation for inclusive design and already incorporate many details that affect dyslexic readers. For example, WCAG <strong>guidance around line length and spacing</strong> match the recommendations I found doing my research. In fact, some of those resources are linked in the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/\">Understanding WCAG 2.1</a> document which provides extended commentary on the guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>We can build upon those foundations to offer more focused support for different communities, making it easier to engage with our websites on their own terms. In this article, we’ll look at ways to make an existing design dyslexia-friendly.</p>\n\n<p>This article builds on English-language research and can be generalized to cover most European languages that use Latin and Cyrillic scripts. For other languages and scripts, you will find you need to tailor or even ignore these guidelines.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"font-selection\">Font Selection</h2>\n\n<blockquote>“The font for the body copy should be chosen for its on-screen readability, before any concern for style.”<br /><br />&mdash; “<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/applying-macrotypography-for-readable-web-page/\">How To Apply Macrotypography For A More Readable Web Page</a>,” Nathan Ford</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I first started researching this topic, I incorrectly believed that I would have to limit my font selection. Luckily, research shows that standard fonts like Helvetica and Times New Roman are just as readable as purpose-built fonts like <a href=\"https://www.dyslexiefont.com/\">Dyslexie</a> or <a href=\"https://opendyslexic.org/\">Open Dyslexic</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What this means for your font selection is that you merely have to select fonts with <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/css-techniques-legibility/\">legibility in mind</a>.</p>\n\n<p>All right, problem solved, let’s go home!</p>\n\n<p>Well, not really. It turns out there is something special about those purpose-built fonts.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"whitespace\">Whitespace</h2>\n\n<blockquote>“It seems that at least for some people with dyslexia, they are vulnerable to a phenomenon called ‘visual crowding’ when they read.”<br /><br />&mdash; <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/health-sciences/people/human-communication-sciences/jenny-thomson\">Dr Jenny Thomson</a></blockquote>\n\n<p>While study after study shows little benefit from the choice of font, they also consistently show <strong>spacing between letters and words</strong> as the most important factor in supporting a dyslexic reader. Jon Severs has written <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/does-comic-sans-really-help-dyslexic-learners\">a very good overview of these studies</a> with quotes from many of the leading researchers.</p>\n\n<p>The popularity of Comic Sans in the dyslexic community seems to be driven by the wider spacing found in that font, spacing that has been built into additional fonts intended for their community.</p>\n\n<p>As designers, we have the power to extend this spacing to any font, letting us support our readers without a major redesign. While we’re at it, we can further <strong>improve things by reducing distractions</strong> and design choices that can produce the visual crowding that affects dyslexic readers.</p>\n\n<div data-audience=\"non-subscriber\" data-remove=\"true\" class=\"feature-panel-container\"><span class=\"feature-panel__desc\">More after jump!

If you’re using a font with a particularly narrow or wide zero, you may find you need to adjust the numbers below.</p>\n\n<p>We’re using Overpass in our example, which has a fairly standard zero, so we can express the recommended numbers directly:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.dyslexia-mode {\n    letter-spacing: 0.35ch;\n    word-spacing: 1.225ch; /* 3.5x letter-spacing */\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Modern browsers default to enabling a font’s common ligatures, and older browsers will do so if you use the unofficial <code>text-rendering: optimizeLegibility</code> property. For most of us, this improves legibility as it merges close-set characters into a single glyph. For example, ‘f’ and ‘i’ are often merged to create ‘ﬁ’.</p>\n\n<p>Dyslexic readers, on the other hand, <strong>may struggle to recognize the ligature</strong> as two letters, especially as we have increased the spacing, making ligatures stand out even more than usual. While some browsers may automatically disable ligatures as a result of the increased letter spacing, for consistent behavior we should explicitly disable them ourselves via CSS:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.dyslexia-mode {\n    letter-spacing: 0.35ch;\n    word-spacing: 1.225ch; /* 3.5x letter-spacing */\n    font-variant-ligatures: none; /* explicitly disable ligatures */\n}</code></pre>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"line-spacing\">Line Spacing</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#visual-presentation\">WCAG guidelines</a> suggest a minimum line height of 1.5, with a paragraph setting at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.</p>\n\n<p>Following this guidance is already quite helpful for your dyslexic readers, but that minimum value is based on the standard word spacing. Since we’re increasing the word spacing, we should increase the line height proportionally.</p>\n\n<p>I find a <strong>line-height of 2.0</strong> works quite well. It’s a little more than the BDA guidance of 1.5x the word spacing, unitless as suggested by <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height#prefer_unitless_numbers_for_line-height_values\">MDN documentation</a>, and easy to sync up to a design’s vertical rhythm.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve the recommended amount of paragraph spacing, in this example we apply a top margin on our <code>p</code> elements. In a larger project, you might want to use Heydon Pickering’s famous <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/\">owl selector</a>, especially if you have nested content.</p>\n\n<p>Following the WCAG suggestion, that top margin should be <strong>a minimum of 3em</strong> to get the desired paragraph spacing. After feedback from my dyslexic reader, I <strong>increased this to 3.5em</strong> which was more comfortable for them.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n  <p>\n    <a class=\"pull-quote__link\" aria-label=\"Share on Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=%0a%20As%20with%20any%20inclusive%20design,%20feedback%20from%20real%20users%20is%20critical%20to%20ensuring%20the%20best%20results.%0a&url=https://smashingmagazine.com%2f2021%2f11%2fdyslexia-friendly-mode-website%2f\">\n      \n As with any inclusive design, feedback from real users is critical to ensuring the best results.\n\n    </a>\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"pull-quote__quotation\">\n    <div class=\"pull-quote__bg\">\n      <span class=\"pull-quote__symbol\">“</span></div>\n  </div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While we could apply these settings to our entire page, I prefer to target them to the main content area, especially when modifying an existing design. Site headers, footers, and navigation tend not to have paragraph content and can be particularly sensitive to vertical whitespace changes.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.dyslexia-mode main {\n   line-height: 2.0;\n}\n\n.dyslexia-mode main p {\n   margin-top: 3.5em;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"other-typographic-changes\">Other Typographic Changes</h2>\n\n<p>At this point, we’ve made the large-scale changes that will have the biggest impact on a dyslexic reader. Now we can turn our thoughts to the smaller touches that help refine a design.</p>\n\n<p>The extra whitespace we’ve introduced will make many fonts appear lighter, thinner, or lower contrast, so we can increase the font weight or adjust the color to compensate.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.dyslexia-mode {\n  font-weight: 600; /* demi-bold */\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>This in turn may make bold (at a font-weight of <code>700</code>) harder to distinguish. You could make it a heavier bold by increasing the font-weight or distinguishing it in some other way like changing the size or color. For my design, I chose to leave it at the same weight, but make it darker than the regular text.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.dyslexia-mode strong {\n  color: #000;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now is a good time to use your developer tools to <strong>check your contrast</strong>. For dyslexic readers, you should aim for a contrast ratio of <strong>at least 4.5:1</strong>, which corresponds to the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum\">WCAG 2.1 minimum contrast guidelines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Why the minimum guidelines? Well, there are two issues to consider. One is that at very high contrast ratios some dyslexic readers will see their text blurring or swirling. This is known as the “blur effect”. This is one of the reasons that the BDA style guide we referenced earlier recommends avoiding pure black text or pure white backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>The second consideration is that many dyslexic readers find <a href=\"https://pielot.org/2013/06/use-18pt-font-size-for-readers-with-dyslexia/\">larger font sizes more readable</a>. Research suggests a base size of 18pt, which meets the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-large-scale\">WCAG definition of large-scale text</a> and therefore a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 will still meet the enhanced contrast guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>Which reminds us, we should <strong>bump up that base font size</strong>!</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.dyslexia-mode {\n  font-size: 150%; /* assuming 16px base size, convert to 18pt */\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Responsive designs tend to scale well with browser zoom settings, so a different strategy here could be to leave your font size untouched and suggest that your readers increase the page zoom in their browser.</p>\n\n<p>Following the WCAG guidelines means that our design does not use justified text, so we don’t have to make an adjustment. Because <strong>justification can alter the spacing</strong> between letters and words, if you have used it, you should ensure you disable it in a dyslexia-friendly mode.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reduce-clutter\">Reduce Clutter</h2>\n\n<p>The extra whitespace we’ve been adding makes it easier to focus on letters and words. That implies that we can be even more helpful by reducing the amount of confusing, cluttered, or potentially distracting things in our design.</p>\n\n<p>Best practices in web design tend to emphasize progressive enhancement and mobile-first design, which <strong>helps keep page weights down and makes web pages resilient</strong>. These practices naturally lead to a minimal default state with fewer decorations and distractions (because these would overwhelm a small screen). We can preserve this minimal state in our dyslexia-friendly mode.</p>\n\n<p>For the background, this means defaulting to a solid color and using the <code>:not</code> pseudo-class in our enhancements to avoid applying them to our new mode.</p>\n\n<p>We can use similar constructs to avoid the creation of decorative borders and shadows, leaving only those that are functionally necessary.</p>\n\n<div class=\"break-out\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@media(min-width:700px) { /* only apply on wider screens... */\n  body:not(.dyslexia-mode) main { /* ...if not in our friendly mode! */\n    background-image: url(https://res.cloudinary.com/jbowtie/image/upload/v1631662164/exclusive_paper_dyitgt.webp);\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>In the existing design, we deliberately make the heading look like an imperfectly applied printed label by rotating it slightly. This is meant to evoke a playful or humanistic touch, and we often see designs adopt little touches like these for similar reasons.</p>\n\n<p>However, this label-like appearance is a prime example of a decorative element that produces <strong>visual crowding</strong>. So even though it works well in a mobile context, we are going to need to remove this touch to provide a better experience for our dyslexic readers.</p>\n\n<div class=\"break-out\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.dyslexia-mode h2 {\n  border: none; border-bottom: thin grey solid;  /* just keeping the bottom border for this element, to retain some separation */\n  max-width: 100%; /* standard width */\n  transform: none; /* do not rotate */\n  background-color: inherit; /* We no longer look like a label, so we don't require our own background */\n  margin-bottom: 1em; padding-left:0; /* some spacing adjustments */\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Zebra striping has long been used when displaying tabular data, but <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/zebrastripingmoredataforthecase/\">research by Jessica Enders</a> shows that the benefits are not necessarily as clear as I thought, and I didn’t find any dyslexia-specific research on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>What I did find was a request from my dyslexic reader to implement <strong>zebra striping for tables and lists</strong>! Once again, real user feedback is invaluable.</p>\n\n<p>I chose to restrict this to the main content, to avoid having to revisit the design of the site navigation. We don’t actually have any tables in our example, but the CSS changes would be quite similar.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.dyslexia-mode main li:nth-of-type(odd) {\n    background-color: palegoldenrod;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"toggling-our-new-mode\">Toggling Our New Mode</h2>\n\n<p>Now that we have a dyslexia-friendly design, we need to decide whether to make it the default, or something that is chosen by the user.</p>\n\n<p>When retrofitting an existing site, as in this example, we’ll probably opt for a mode, to reduce the impact of changes on existing users.</p>\n\n<p>In building a new site or refreshing a design, we should consider which changes we can make the default, for the benefit of all users. As with any other design work, you’re <strong>balancing the needs of multiple audiences</strong>, branding constraints, and tensions with other design goals such as evoking specific moods or keeping certain information “above the fold”.</p>\n\n<p>Switching between modes is accomplished by toggling the class on the body element. Here we do it with a toggle button and some JavaScript, using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\"><code>localStorage</code></a> to persist the change across visits and pages. This could be set and stored as part of a user profile.</p>\n\n<div class=\"break-out\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">    // toggle dyslexia support\n    const isPressed = window.localStorage.getItem('dyslexic') === 'true';\n    if(isPressed) {\n        document.body.classList.add('dyslexia-mode');\n    }\n    // set the button to pressed if appropriate\n    const toggle = document.getElementById('dyslexia-toggle');\n    if(isPressed) {\n        toggle.setAttribute('aria-pressed', 'true');\n    }\n    // toggle dyslexia support\n    toggle.addEventListener('click', (e) => {\n        let pressed = e.target.getAttribute('aria-pressed') === 'true';\n        e.target.setAttribute('aria-pressed', String(!pressed));\n        document.body.classList.toggle('dyslexia-mode');\n        window.localStorage.setItem('dyslexic', String(!pressed));\n    });</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"break-out\">\n\t<p data-height=\"500\"\n\tdata-theme-id=\"light\"\n\tdata-slug-hash=\"dyzwqXm\"\n\tdata-user=\"smashingmag\"\n\tdata-default-tab=\"result\"\n\tclass=\"codepen\">See the Pen [Dyslexia-friendly mode added](https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/dyzwqXm) by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/jbowtie\">John C Barstow</a>.</p>\n\t<figcaption>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/dyzwqXm\">Dyslexia-friendly mode added</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/jbowtie\">John C Barstow</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>The separation of content and presentation that CSS gives us always comes in handy when we need to adapt designs to better serve different communities.</p>\n\n<p>Building on the solid foundations of a design that embraces accessibility guidelines, we’ve learned to extend our design to <strong>improve the experience for dyslexic readers</strong>. There are other audiences that could benefit from this kind of focused design work, and I hope this inspires you to seek them out and share your experience.</p>\n\n<p>This design was tested with a small and possibly unrepresentative sample size. If you or someone you know has dyslexia, your feedback in the comments below about what does or doesn’t work would be very welcome and helpful!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"additional-references\">Additional References</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071161\">Shorter Lines Facilitate Reading in Those Who Struggle</a>,” Matthew H.

We will create the React app once we’ve established how to make things work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Before we get started. It’s worth noting that the performance of this demo is affected by the grid size and the demos are best viewed in Chromium-based browsers.</em></p>\n\n<p>Let’s start by creating a grid. Let’s say we want a 10 by 10 grid. That’s 100 cells (This is why React is handy for something like this). Each cell is going to consist of an element that contains the front and back for a flippable card.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;div class=\"flippy-snap\"&gt;\n  &lt;!-- 100 of these --&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"flippy-snap__card flippy-card\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"flippy-card__front&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"flippy-card__rear&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>The styles for our grid are quite straightforward. We can use <code>display: grid</code> and use a custom property for the grid size. Here we are defaulting to <code>10</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">.flippy-snap {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-gap: 1px;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--grid-size, 10), 1fr);\n  grid-template-rows: repeat(var(--grid-size, 10), 1fr);\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>We won’t use <code>grid-gap</code> in the final demo, but, it’s good for seeing the cells easier whilst developing.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"break-out\">\n\t<p data-height=\"500\"\n\tdata-theme-id=\"light\"\n\tdata-slug-hash=\"porXNzB\"\n\tdata-user=\"smashingmag\"\n\tdata-default-tab=\"result\"\n\tclass=\"codepen\">See the Pen [1.

Creating a Grid</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/jh3y\">JHEY</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Next, we need to style the sides of our cards and display images. We can do this by leveraging inline CSS custom properties. Let’s start by updating the markup. We need each card to know its <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> position in the grid.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;div class=\"flippy-snap\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"flippy-snap__card flippy-card\" style=\"--x: 0; --y: 0;\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"flippy-card__front\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"flippy-card__rear\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"flippy-snap__card flippy-card\" style=\"--x: 1; --y: 0;\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"flippy-card__front\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"flippy-card__rear\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;!-- Other cards --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>For the demo, I&rsquo;m using <code>Pug</code> to generate this for me. You can see the compiled HTML by clicking “View Compiled HTML” in the demo.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">- const GRID_SIZE = 10\n- const COUNT = Math.pow(GRID_SIZE, 2)\n.flippy-snap\n  - for(let f = 0; f < COUNT; f++)\n    - const x = f % GRID_SIZE  \n    - const y = Math.floor(f / GRID_SIZE)\n    .flippy-snap__card.flippy-card(style=`--x: ${x}; --y: ${y};`)\n      .flippy-card__front\n      .flippy-card__rear</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then we need some styles.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">.flippy-card {\n  --current-image: url(\"https://random-image.com/768\");\n  --next-image: url(\"https://random-image.com/124\");\n  height: 100%;\n  width: 100%;\n  position: relative;\n}\n.flippy-card__front,\n.flippy-card__rear {\n  position: absolute;\n  height: 100%;\n  width: 100%;\n  backface-visibility: hidden;\n  background-image: var(--current-image);\n  background-position: calc(var(--x, 0) * -100%) calc(var(--y, 0) * -100%);\n  background-size: calc(var(--grid-size, 10) * 100%);\n}\n.flippy-card__rear {\n  background-image: var(--next-image);\n  transform: rotateY(180deg) rotate(180deg);\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>The rear of the card gets its position using a combination of rotations via <code>transform</code>. But, the interesting part is how we show the image part for each card. In this demo, we are using a custom property to define the URLs for two images. And then we set those as the <code>background-image</code> for each card face.</p>\n\n<div data-audience=\"non-subscriber\" data-remove=\"true\" class=\"feature-panel-container\"><span class=\"feature-panel__desc\">More after jump!

Using the custom properties <code>--x</code> and <code>--y</code> we multiply the value by <code>-100%</code>. And then we set the <code>background-size</code> to <code>--grid-size</code> multiplied by <code>100%</code>. This gives displays the correct part of the image for a given card.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"break-out\">\n\t<p data-height=\"500\"\n\tdata-theme-id=\"light\"\n\tdata-slug-hash=\"gOxNLPz\"\n\tdata-user=\"smashingmag\"\n\tdata-default-tab=\"result\"\n\tclass=\"codepen\">See the Pen [2.

But, currently, there is no way to see the next image. For that, we need a way to flip our cards. We can use another custom property for this.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s introduce a <code>--count</code> property and set a <code>transform</code> for our cards:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">.flippy-snap {\n  --count: 0;\n  perspective: 50vmin;\n}\n.flippy-card {\n  transform: rotateX(calc(var(--count) * -180deg));\n  transition: transform 0.25s;\n  transform-style: preserve-3d;\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can set the <code>--count</code> property on the containing element. Scoping means all the cards can pick up that value and use it to <code>transform</code> their rotation on the x-axis. We also need to set <code>transform-style: preserve-3d</code> so that we see the back of the cards. Setting a <code>perspective</code> gives us that 3D perspective.</p>\n\n<p>This demo lets you update the <code>--count</code> property value so you can see the effect it has.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"break-out\">\n\t<p data-height=\"500\"\n\tdata-theme-id=\"light\"\n\tdata-slug-hash=\"LYjKbZW\"\n\tdata-user=\"smashingmag\"\n\tdata-default-tab=\"result\"\n\tclass=\"codepen\">See the Pen [3.

[newSnap, snaps[1]] : [snaps[0], newSnap]\n    )\n    setDisabled(false)\n  }\n\n  const onFlip = async count =&gt; {\n    setDisabled(true)\n    setNewImage(count)\n  }\n\n  if (snaps.length !== 2) return &lt;h1 className=\"loader\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n  return (\n    &lt;FlippySnap\n      gridSize={gridSize}\n      disabled={disabled}\n      snaps={snaps}\n      onFlip={onFlip}\n      snapRef={snapRef}\n    /&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Our <code>App</code> component handles grabbing images and passing them to our <code>FlippySnap</code> component. That’s the bulk of what’s happening here. For this demo, we’re grabbing images from <a href=\"https://source.unsplash.com\">Unsplash</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const grabPic = async () =&gt; {\n  const pic = await fetch('https://source.unsplash.com/random/1000x1000')\n  return pic.url\n}\n\n// Initial effect grabs two snaps to be used by FlippySnap\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\n  const setup = async () =&gt; {\n    const url = await grabPic()\n    const nextUrl = await grabPic()\n    setSnaps([url, nextUrl])\n    setDisabled(false)\n  }\n  setup()\n}, [])</code></pre>\n\n<p>If there aren’t two snaps to show, then we show a “Loading&hellip;” message.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">if (snaps.length !== 2) return &lt;h1 className=\"loader\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we are grabbing a new image, we need to disable <code>FlippySnap</code> so we can’t spam-click it.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;FlippySnap\n  gridSize={gridSize}\n  disabled={disabled} // Toggle a \"disabled\" prop to stop spam clicks\n  snaps={snaps}\n  onFlip={onFlip}\n  snapRef={snapRef}\n/&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>We’re letting <code>App</code> dictate the snaps that get displayed by <code>FlippySnap</code> and in which order. On each flip, we grab a new image, and depending on how many times we’ve flipped, we set the correct snaps. The alternative would be to set the snaps and let the component figure out the order.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const setNewImage = async count =&gt; {\n  const newSnap = await grabPic() // Grab the snap\n  setSnaps(\n    count.current % 2 !== 0 ? [newSnap, snaps[1]] : [snaps[0], newSnap]\n  ) // Set the snaps based on the current \"count\" which we get from FlippySnap\n  setDisabled(false) // Enable clicks again\n}\n\nconst onFlip = async count =&gt; {\n  setDisabled(true) // Disable so we can't spam click\n  setNewImage(count) // Grab a new snap to display\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>How might <code>FlippySnap</code> look? There isn’t much to it at all!</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const FlippySnap = ({ disabled, gridSize, onFlip, snaps }) =&gt; {\n  const CELL_COUNT = Math.pow(gridSize, 2)\n  const count = useRef(0)\n\n  const flip = e =&gt; {\n    if (disabled) return\n    count.current = count.current + 1\n    if (onFlip) onFlip(count)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    &lt;button\n      className=\"flippy-snap\"\n      ref={containerRef}\n      style={{\n        '--grid-size': gridSize,\n        '--count': count.current,\n        '--current-image': `url('${snaps[0]}')`,\n        '--next-image': `url('${snaps[1]}')`,\n      }}\n      onClick={flip}&gt;\n      {new Array(CELL_COUNT).fill().map((cell, index) =&gt; {\n        const x = index % gridSize\n        const y = Math.floor(index / gridSize)\n        return (\n          &lt;span\n            key={index}\n            className=\"flippy-card\"\n            style={{\n              '--x': x,\n              '--y': y,\n            }}&gt;\n            &lt;span className=\"flippy-card__front\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;span className=\"flippy-card__rear\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;/span&gt;\n        )\n      })}\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>The component handles rendering all the cards and setting the inline custom properties. The <code>onClick</code> handler for the container increments the <code>count</code>. It also triggers the <code>onFlip</code> callback. If the state is currently <code>disabled</code>, it does nothing. That flip of the <code>disabled</code> state and grabbing a new snap triggers the flip when the component re-renders.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"break-out\">\n\t<p data-height=\"500\"\n\tdata-theme-id=\"light\"\n\tdata-slug-hash=\"wvqLdGY\"\n\tdata-user=\"smashingmag\"\n\tdata-default-tab=\"result\"\n\tclass=\"codepen\">See the Pen [5.

React Foundation</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/jh3y\">JHEY</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>We have a React component that will now flip through images for as long as we want to keep requesting new ones. But, that flip transition is a bit boring. To spice it up, we’re going to make use of <a href=\"https://greensock.com\">GreenSock</a> and its utilities. In particular, the “<a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods/distribute\">distribute</a>” utility. This will allow us to distribute the delay of flipping our cards in a grid-like burst from wherever we click. To do this, we’re going to use GreenSock to animate the <code>--count</code> value on each card.</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that we have a choice here. We could opt to apply the styles with GreenSock. Instead of animating the <code>--count</code> property value, we could animate <code>rotateX</code>. We could do this based on the <code>count</code> ref we have. And this also goes for any other things we choose to animate with GreenSock in this article. It’s down to preference and use case. You may feel that updating the custom property value makes sense. The benefit being that you don’t need to update any JavaScript to get a different styled behavior. We could change the CSS to use <code>rotateY</code> for example.</p>\n\n<p>Our updated <code>flip</code> function could look like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"break-out\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const flip = e =&gt; {\n  if (disabled) return\n  const x = parseInt(e.target.parentNode.getAttribute('data-snap-x'), 10)\n  const y = parseInt(e.target.parentNode.getAttribute('data-snap-y'), 10)\n  count.current = count.current + 1\n  gsap.to(containerRef.current.querySelectorAll('.flippy-card'), {\n    '--count': count.current,\n    delay: gsap.utils.distribute({\n      from: [x / gridSize, y / gridSize],\n      amount: gridSize / 20,\n      base: 0,\n      grid: [gridSize, gridSize],\n      ease: 'power1.inOut',\n    }),\n    duration: 0.2,\n    onComplete: () =&gt; {\n      // At this point update the images\n      if (onFlip) onFlip(count)\n    },\n  })\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Note how we’re getting an <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> value by reading attributes of the clicked card. For this demo, we’ve opted for adding some <code>data</code> attributes to each card. These attributes communicate a card&rsquo;s position in the grid. We’re also using a new <code>ref</code> called <code>containerRef</code>. This is so we reference only the cards for a <code>FlippySnap</code> instance when using GreenSock.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">{new Array(CELL_COUNT).fill().map((cell, index) =&gt; {\n  const x = index % gridSize\n  const y = Math.floor(index / gridSize)\n  return (\n    &lt;span\n      className=\"flippy-card\"\n      data-snap-x={x}\n      data-snap-y={y}\n      style={{\n        '--x': x,\n        '--y': y,\n      }}&gt;\n      &lt;span className=\"flippy-card__front\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n      &lt;span className=\"flippy-card__rear\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n  )\n})}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once we get those <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values, we can make use of them in our animation. Using <code>gsap.to</code> we want to animate the <code>--count</code> custom property for every <code>.flippy-card</code> that’s a child of <code>containerRef</code>.</p>\n\n<p>To distribute the delay from where we click, we set the value of <code>delay</code> to use <code>gsap.utils.distribute</code>. The <code>from</code> value of the <code>distribute</code> function takes an Array containing ratios along the x and y axis. To get this, we divide <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> by <code>gridSize</code>. The <code>base</code> value is the initial value. For this, we want <code>0</code> delay on the card we click. The <code>amount</code> is the largest value. We&rsquo;ve gone for <code>gridSize / 20</code> but you could experiment with different values. Something based on the <code>gridSize</code> is a good idea though. The <code>grid</code> value tells GreenSock the grid size to use when calculating distribution. Last but not least, the <code>ease</code> defines the ease of the <code>delay</code> distribution.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">gsap.to(containerRef.current.querySelectorAll('.flippy-card'), {\n  '--count': count.current,\n  delay: gsap.utils.distribute({\n    from: [x / gridSize, y / gridSize],\n    amount: gridSize / 20,\n    base: 0,\n    grid: [gridSize, gridSize],\n    ease: 'power1.inOut',\n  }),\n  duration: 0.2,\n  onComplete: () =&gt; {\n    // At this point update the images\n    if (onFlip) onFlip(count)\n  },\n})</code></pre>\n\n<p>As for the rest of the animation, we are using a flip duration of <code>0.2</code> seconds. And we make use of <code>onComplete</code> to invoke our callback. We pass the flip <code>count</code> to the callback so it can use this to determine snap order. Things like the duration of the flip could get configured by passing in different <code>props</code> if we wished.</p>\n\n<p>Putting it all together gives us this:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"break-out\">\n\t<p data-height=\"500\"\n\tdata-theme-id=\"light\"\n\tdata-slug-hash=\"VwzJbpM\"\n\tdata-user=\"smashingmag\"\n\tdata-default-tab=\"result\"\n\tclass=\"codepen\">See the Pen [6.

And that’s because we don’t disable <code>FlippySnap</code> until GreenSock has completed. To fix this, we can use an internal ref that we toggle at the start and end of using GreenSock.</p>\n\n<div class=\"break-out\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const flipping = useRef(false) // New ref to track the flipping state\n\nconst flip = e =&gt; {\n  if (disabled || flipping.current) return\n  const x = parseInt(e.target.parentNode.getAttribute('data-snap-x'), 10)\n  const y = parseInt(e.target.parentNode.getAttribute('data-snap-y'), 10)\n  count.current = count.current + 1\n  gsap.to(containerRef.current.querySelectorAll('.flippy-card'), {\n    '--count': count.current,\n    delay: gsap.utils.distribute({\n      from: [x / gridSize, y / gridSize],\n      amount: gridSize / 20,\n      base: 0,\n      grid: [gridSize, gridSize],\n      ease: 'power1.inOut',\n    }),\n    duration: 0.2,\n    onStart: () =&gt; {\n      flipping.current = true\n    },\n    onComplete: () =&gt; {\n      // At this point update the images\n      flipping.current = false\n      if (onFlip) onFlip(count)\n    },\n  })\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>And now we can no longer spam click our <code>FlippySnap</code>!</p>\n\n<figure class=\"break-out\">\n\t<p data-height=\"500\"\n\tdata-theme-id=\"light\"\n\tdata-slug-hash=\"jOLjmXE\"\n\tdata-user=\"smashingmag\"\n\tdata-default-tab=\"result\"\n\tclass=\"codepen\">See the Pen [7.

At the moment, there’s no visual sign that we can click our <code>FlippySnap</code>. What if when we hover, the cards raise towards us? We could use <code>onPointerOver</code> and use the “distribute” utility again.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const indicate = e =&gt; {\n  const x = parseInt(e.currentTarget.getAttribute('data-snap-x'), 10)\n  const y = parseInt(e.currentTarget.getAttribute('data-snap-y'), 10)\n  gsap.to(containerRef.current.querySelectorAll('.flippy-card'), {\n    '--hovered': gsap.utils.distribute({\n      from: [x / gridSize, y / gridSize],\n      base: 0,\n      amount: 1,\n      grid: [gridSize, gridSize],\n      ease: 'power1.inOut'\n    }),\n    duration: 0.1,\n  })\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we are setting a new custom property on each card named <code>--hovered</code>. This is set to a value from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code>. Then within our CSS, we are going to update our card styles to watch for the value.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">.flippy-card {\n  transform: translate3d(0, 0, calc((1 - (var(--hovered, 1))) * 5vmin))\n             rotateX(calc(var(--count) * -180deg));\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we are saying that a card will move on the z-axis at most <code>5vmin</code>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<p>We then apply this to each card using the <code>onPointerOver</code> prop.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">{new Array(CELL_COUNT).fill().map((cell, index) =&gt; {\n  const x = index % gridSize\n  const y = Math.floor(index / gridSize)\n  return (\n    &lt;span\n      onPointerOver={indicate}\n      className=\"flippy-card\"\n      data-snap-x={x}\n      data-snap-y={y}\n      style={{\n        '--x': x,\n          '--y': y,\n      }}&gt;\n      &lt;span className=\"flippy-card__front\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n      &lt;span className=\"flippy-card__rear\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n  )\n})}</code></pre>\n\n<p>And when our pointer leaves our <code>FlippySnap</code> we want to reset our card positions.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nconst reset = () =&gt; {\n  gsap.to(containerRef.current.querySelectorAll('.flippy-card'), {\n    '--hovered': 1,\n    duration: 0.1,\n  })\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>And we can apply this with the <code>onPointerLeave</code> prop.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;button\n  className=\"flippy-snap\"\n  ref={containerRef}\n  onPointerLeave={reset}\n  style={{\n    '--grid-size': gridSize,\n    '--count': count.current,\n    '--current-image': `url('${snaps[0]}')`,\n    '--next-image': `url('${snaps[1]}')`,\n  }}\n  onClick={flip}&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Put that all together and we get something like this.

Commands like <code>commit</code>, <code>push</code>, and <code>pull</code> have made it into our fingers&#8217; muscle memory. But relatively few developers know about the &#8220;more advanced&#8221; features in Git — and how incredibly valuable they can be! In this article, we&#8217;re going to explore &#8220;interactive rebase&#8221;, one of the most powerful tools in Git.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"whyinteractiverebaseshouldbepartofeverydeveloperstoolbelt\">Why Interactive Rebase Should be Part of Every Developer’s Tool Belt</h2>\n<p>In a nutshell, and without exaggeration, interactive rebase can help you become a better developer, by allowing you to create a clean and well-structured commit history in your projects. </p>\n<p>Why is a well-structured commit history important? Just imagine the opposite: a hard-to-read commit history, where you have no idea what your colleagues <em>actually</em> did with their recent changes. More and more &#8220;dark corners&#8221; start to emerge in such as project, and you only understand the small parts that you worked on yourself.</p>\n<p>Contrast this with a clean and well-structured commit history: it helps make a project’s codebase <em>more readable</em> and <em>easier to understand</em>. This is an essential ingredient for a healthy, long-lasting project!</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatinteractiverebasecandoforyou\">What Interactive Rebase Can Do for You</h2>\n<p>Interactive Rebase helps you optimize and clean up your commit history. It covers many different use cases, some of which allow you to to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>edit an old commit message</li>\n<li>delete a commit</li>\n<li>squash/combine multiple commits</li>\n<li>reorder commits</li>\n<li>fix old commits</li>\n<li>split/reopen old commits for editing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whentouseinteractiverebaseandwhennotto\">When to Use Interactive Rebase (and When Not To!)</h2>\n<p>Like a couple of other Git tools, interactive rebase “rewrites history”. This means that, when you manipulate a series of commits using interactive rebase, this part of your commit history will be <em>rewritten</em>: the commit&#8217;s SHA-1 hashes will have changed. They&#8217;re completely new commit objects, so to speak.</p>\n<p>This fact calls for a simple but important rule to live by: don&#8217;t use interactive rebase (or other tools that rewrite history) on commits that you&#8217;ve already shared with your colleagues on a remote repository. Instead, use it to clean up your own, local commits — such as in one of your own feature branches — before merging them into a team branch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebasicmechanismofaninteractiverebaseoperation\">The Basic Mechanism of an Interactive Rebase Operation</h2>\n<p>Although there are many different things that interactive rebase can be used for, the <em>basic workflow</em> is always the same. Once you&#8217;ve firmly understood this basic mechanism, interactive rebase will lose its air of &#8220;complex mystery&#8221; and become a valuable, accessible item in your tool belt.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step1whereshouldyoustartthesession\">Step 1: Where should you start the session?</h3>\n<p>The first question you need to answer is: &#8220;What part of my commit history do I want to manipulate?&#8221; This tells you where you should start your interactive rebase session. Let&#8217;s make a practical example and say we&#8217;d like to edit an old commit message (which is what we&#8217;ll actually do in practice in a moment).</p>\n<p>Our starting situation is pictured below, where we&#8217;re editing an old commit message via interactive rebase.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622792344diagram-edit-commit-message@2x.png\" alt=\"Editing an old commit message via interactive rebase\" /></p>\n<p>To be able to change the commit message in <code>C2</code>, we have to start our interactive rebase session at its parent commit (or even before that, if you want to). In this example case, we would use <code>C1</code> as the starting point for our interactive rebase session.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step2startingtheactualsession\">Step 2: starting the actual session!</h3>\n<p>Starting the actual session is pretty simple:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ git rebase -i HEAD~3\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re using the <code>git rebase</code> command with the <code>-i</code> flag (to indicate we indeed want it to be &#8220;interactive&#8221;) and provide the base commit (that we came up with in our first step above). In this example, I&#8217;ve used <code>HEAD~3</code> to specify the commit that&#8217;s &#8220;3 behind the HEAD commit&#8221;. Alternatively, I also could have provided a specific SHA-1 hash.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step3tellinggitwhatyouwanttodo\">Step 3: telling Git what you want to do</h3>\n<p>After starting the interactive rebase session, you&#8217;ll be presented with an editor window where Git lists a series of commits — from the latest commit, all the way to (but not including) the one you picked as a base commit in Step 1.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622792374editor-window-after-starting-ir@2x.png\" alt=\"An editor window opens up after starting the interactive rebase session\" /></p>\n<p>There are two important things to keep in mind in this step:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Commits are listed in reverse order!</strong> The newest commit, which we would expect to appear at the <em>top</em>, will appear at the <em>bottom</em> of the list. Don&#8217;t worry: your Git repository is fit as a fiddle! 🥳 Remember that we&#8217;re in the process of performing an interactive rebase operation, and this requires Git to reapply the commits from oldest to newest at the end of the operation.</li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t make your actual changes in this editor window!</strong> Although you might be itching to simply go ahead and change the commit message in this editor window (after all, that&#8217;s what we actually want to do …), you have to show some patience. Here, we are only going to tell Git <em>what</em> we want to do — but not make the actual change. I&#8217;ll demonstrate this point in practice shortly!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With this theoretical overview out of the way, let&#8217;s dive into some practical cases together!</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/git-interactive-rebase-guide/?utm_source=rss\">A Guide to Git Interactive Rebase, with Practical Examples</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Since the earliest days of programming, the problem of code repetition has made programmers invent strategies for keeping their code <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\">DRY</a>, reusable and portable. As time has passed, these strategies have been constantly polished and improved, and new ones are constantly developed. </p>\n<p>This applies equally to <a href=\"https://v3.vuejs.org/\">Vue</a> as to other programming languages and frameworks. As the Vue framework has evolved, it it has continued to offer much better reusability approaches. </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_0\">What Is Composition API and Why It Was Created</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s consider what makes a piece of code reusable. For me, there are three main principles of reusability:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Code abstraction</strong>. A piece of code is abstract when it can suit multiple different use cases (like classes in many programming languages).</li>\n<li><strong>Code portability</strong>. A piece of code is portable when it can be used not only in different places in one project but also in different projects. </li>\n<li><strong>Code decoupling (or loose coupling)</strong>. A piece of code is decoupled from another one when changing one doesn&rsquo;t require changing the other. They&rsquo;re as independent of each other as possible. Of course, complete decoupling is impossible — which is why the more accurate term used by developers is “loosely coupled”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Composition API is a new strategy for building and structuring Vue 3 components. It incorporates all of the three principles described above and allows for creating abstract, portable, and loosely coupled components that can be reused and shared between different projects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc_1\">Motivation to Add the Vue Composition API to the Framework</h3>\n<p>The motivation for the Composition API to be added to Vue 3 is clear and simple: producing more compact and defragmented code. Let&rsquo;s explore this a bit more.</p>\n<p>When I found Vue for the first time, I was hooked by its Options (object-based) API. It seemed to me way more clear and elegant in contrast to the Angular and React equivalents. Everything has its own place and I can just put it in there. When I have some data, I put it in a <code>data</code> option; when I have some functions, I put them in a <code>methods</code> option, and so on:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Options API example\r\nexport default {\r\n  props: [&#39;title&#39;, &#39;message&#39;],\r\n\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      width: 30,\r\n      height: 40\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  computed: {\r\n    rectArea() {\r\n      return this.width * this.height\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  methods: {\r\n    displayMessage () {\r\n      console.log(`${this.title}: ${this.message}`)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>All this seems quite ordered, clean, and easy to read and understand. It turns out, however, that this is valid only while an app is relatively small and simple. As the app and its components grow more and more, the code fragmentation and disorder increase. </p>\n<p>When the Options API is used in large projects, the code base soon starts to become like a fragmented hard disk. Different parts of the code in a component, which logically belong together, are spread in different places. This makes the code hard to read, understand and maintain. </p>\n<p>This is where the Composition API comes into play. It offers a way to structure the code in order, where all logical parts are grouped together as a unit. To some extent, you can imagine the Composition API as a disk defragmentation tool. It helps you to keep the code compact and clean.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a simplified visual example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1635527518options-vs-composition-api.png\" alt=\"Options vs the Composition API\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see, a component&rsquo;s code built with Options API could be quite fragmented, while a component&rsquo;s code built with the Composition API is grouped by features and looks much easier to read and maintain. </p>\n<h3 id=\"toc_2\">Vue Composition API Advantages</h3>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of the main advantages the Composition API offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better code composition.</li>\n<li>Logically related blocks are kept together.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://antfu.github.io/vue-composition-api-benchmark-results/\">Better overall performance compared to Vue 2</a>.</li>\n<li>Cleaner code. The code is logically better ordered, which makes it much more meaningful and easy to read and understand.</li>\n<li>Easy to extract and import functionality.</li>\n<li>TypeScript support, which improves IDE integrations and code assistance, and code debugging. (This is not a feature of the Composition API, but it&rsquo;s worth mentioning it as a feature of Vue 3.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"toc_3\">Composition API Basics</h2>\n<p>Despite its power and flexibility the Composition API is quite simple. To use it in a component, we need to add a <code>setup()</code> function, which in fact is just another option added to the Options API: </p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default {\r\n  setup() {\r\n    // Composition API\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Inside the <code>setup()</code> function, we can create reactive variables, and functions to manipulate them. Then we can return those variables and/or functions, which we want to be available in the rest of the component. To make reactive variables, you&rsquo;ll need to use the <a href=\"https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/reactivity-fundamentals.html\">Reactivity API</a> functions (<code>ref()</code>, <code>reactive()</code>, <code>computed()</code>, and so on). To learn more about their usage, you can explore this <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/vue-3-reactivity-system/\">comprehensive tutorial about the Vue 3 Reacivity system</a>.</p>\n<p>The <code>setup()</code> function accepts two arguments: <code>props</code> and <code>context</code>. </p>\n<p><em>Props</em> are reactive and will be updated when new props are passed in:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default {\r\n  props: [&quot;message&quot;],\r\n  setup(props) {\r\n    console.log(props.message)\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>If you want to destructure your props, you can do this by using <code>toRefs()</code> inside the <code>setup()</code> function. If you use ES6 destructuring instead, it <em>will remove</em> props reactivity:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { toRefs } from &#39;vue&#39;\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  props: [&quot;message&quot;],\r\n  setup(props) {\r\n//  const { message } = props   &lt;-- ES6 destructuring. The &#39;message&#39; is NOT reactive now.\r\n    const { message } = toRefs(props) // Using &#39;toRefs()&#39; keeps reactivity.\r\n    console.log(message.value)\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p><em>Context</em> is a normal JavaScript object (not reactive) that exposes other useful values like <code>attrs</code>, <code>slots</code>, <code>emit</code>. These are equivalents to <code>$attrs</code>, <code>$slots</code>, and <code>$emit</code> from the Options API.</p>\n<p>The <code>setup()</code> function is executed before the component instance creation. So you won&rsquo;t have access to the following component options: <code>data</code>, <code>computed</code>, <code>methods</code>, and template refs.</p>\n<p>In the <code>setup()</code> function, you can access a component&rsquo;s lifecycle hook by using the <code>on</code> prefix. For example, <code>mounted</code> will become <code>onMounted</code>. The lifecycle functions accept a callback that will be executed when the hook is called by the component:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default {\r\n  props: [&quot;message&quot;],\r\n  setup(props) {\r\n    onMounted(() =&gt; {\r\n      console.log(`Message: ${props.message}`)\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p><em>Note: you don&rsquo;t need to call the <code>beforeCreate</code> and <code>created</code> hooks explicitly, because the <code>setup()</code> function does a similar job by itself. In a <code>setup()</code> function, <code>this</code> isn&rsquo;t a reference to the current active instance, because <code>setup()</code> is called before other component options are resolved.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"toc_4\">Comparing the Options API with the Composition API</h3>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s make a quick comparison between the Options and Composition APIs.</p>\n<p>First, here&rsquo;s a simple to-do app component, built with the Options API, with abilities to add and remove tasks:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markup\">&lt;template&gt;\r\n  &lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;h4&gt; {{ name }}&#39;s To Do List &lt;/h4&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;input v-model=&quot;newItemText&quot; v-on:keyup.enter=&quot;addNewTodo&quot; /&gt;\r\n      &lt;button v-on:click=&quot;addNewTodo&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;button v-on:click=&quot;removeTodo&quot;&gt;Remove&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;transition-group name=&quot;list&quot; tag=&quot;ol&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;li v-for=&quot;task in tasks&quot; v-bind:key=&quot;task&quot; &gt;{{ task }}&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;/transition-group&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\r\n  export default {\r\n    data() { \r\n      return {\r\n        name: &quot;Ivaylo&quot;,\r\n        tasks: [&quot;Write my posts&quot;, &quot;Go for a walk&quot;, &quot;Meet my friends&quot;, &quot;Buy fruit&quot;],\r\n        newItemText: &quot;&quot;\r\n    }},\r\n    methods: {\r\n      addNewTodo() {\r\n        if (this.newItemText != &quot;&quot;) {\r\n          this.tasks.unshift(this.newItemText);\r\n        }\r\n        this.newItemText = &quot;&quot;;\r\n      },\r\n      removeTodo() {\r\n        this.tasks.shift();\r\n      },\r\n    }\r\n  }; \r\n&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve omitted the CSS code here for brevity and because it&rsquo;s not relevant. You can see the full code in the <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/jOLeJJb\">Vue 2 Options API example</a>. <!--https://codepen.io/codeknack/pen/BadKOKy--></p>\n<p>As you can see, this is quite a simple example. We have three data variables and two methods. Let&rsquo;s see  how to rewrite them with the Composition API in mind:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\r\n  import { ref, readonly } from &quot;vue&quot;\r\n\r\n  export default {\r\n    setup () {\r\n      const name = ref(&quot;Ivaylo&quot;)\r\n      const tasks = ref([&quot;Write my posts&quot;, &quot;Go for a walk&quot;, &quot;Meet my friends&quot;, &quot;Buy fruit&quot;])\r\n      const newItemText = ref(&quot;&quot;) \r\n\r\n      const addNewTodo = () =&gt; {\r\n        if (newItemText.value != &quot;&quot;) {\r\n          tasks.value.unshift(newItemText.value);\r\n        }\r\n        newItemText.value = &quot;&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n      const removeTodo = () =&gt; {\r\n        tasks.value.shift();\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      return {\r\n        name: readonly(name),\r\n        tasks: readonly(tasks),\r\n        newItemText,\r\n        addNewTodo,\r\n        removeTodo\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }; \r\n&lt;/script&gt; </code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>As you can see in <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/KKvGEYz\">this Vue 3 Composition API example</a><!-- https://codepen.io/codeknack/pen/oNBbGom -->, the functionality is the same but all data variables and methods are moved inside a <code>setup()</code> function.</p>\n<p>To recreate the three data reactive variables, we use the <code>ref()</code> function. Then, we recreate the <code>addNewTodo()</code> and <code>removeTodo()</code> functions. Note that all uses of <code>this</code> are removed and instead variable names are used directly followed by the <code>value</code> property. So instead of <code>this.newItemText</code> we write <code>newItemText.value</code>, and so on. Finally, we return the variables and functions so they can be used in the component&rsquo;s template. Note that, when we use them in the template, we don&rsquo;t need to use the <code>value</code> property, because all returned values are <a href=\"https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/reactivity-fundamentals.html#ref-unwrapping\">automatically shallow unwrapped</a>. So we don&rsquo;t need to change anything in the template.</p>\n<p>We make the <code>name</code> and <code>tasks</code> read-only to prevent them from any changes outside of the component. In this case, the <code>tasks</code> property can be changed only by <code>addNewTodo()</code> and <code>removeTodo()</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc_5\">When the Composition API is a good fit for a component and when it isn&rsquo;t</h3>\n<p>Just because some new technology is created doesn&rsquo;t mean you need it or must use it. Before deciding whether to use a new technology, you should think about whether you really need it. Although the Composition API offers some great benefits, using it in small and simple projects can lead to unnecessary complexity. The principle is the same as with <a href=\"https://vuex.vuejs.org/\">Vuex</a> usage: it can be too complicated for small projects. </p>\n<p>For example, if your components are mostly single-feature — that is, they do only one thing — you don&rsquo;t need to add unnecessary cognitive load by using the Composition API. But if you notice that your components are getting complex and multi-featured — they handle more than one single task and/or their functionality is needed in many places in you app — then you should consider using the Composition API. In medium to large projects with lots of complex, multi-featured components, the Composition API will help you produce highly reusable and maintainable code without unnecessary hacks or workarounds.</p>\n<p>So you can take the following rules as a general advice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Options API</strong> is best for building small, simple, single-feature components whose functionality requires low reusability.</li>\n<li><strong>The Composition API</strong> is best for building larger and more complex, multi-featured components whose functionality requires higher reusability. </li>\n</ul>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/vue-composition-api-reusable-components/?utm_source=rss\">How to Create Reusable Components with the Vue 3 Composition API</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript. In other words, it adds <em>types</em> to JavaScript — and hence the name. But why would you want these types? What benefits do they bring? And do you need to rewrite your entire codebase to take advantage of them? Those questions, and more, will be answered in this TypeScript tutorial for beginners.</strong></p>\n<p><em>We assume a basic knowledge of JavaScript and its tooling, but zero prior knowledge of TypeScript is required to follow along.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"someerroneousjavascriptcode\">Some Erroneous JavaScript Code</h2>\n<p>To start with, let&#8217;s look at some fairly standard plain JavaScript code that you might come across in any given codebase. It fetches some images from the <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/api/\">Pexels API</a> and inserts them to the DOM.</p>\n<p>However, this code has a few typos in it that are going to cause problems. See if you can spot them:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const PEXELS_API_KEY = '...';\r\n\r\nasync function fetchImages(searchTerm, perPage) {\r\n  const result = await fetch(`https://api.pexels.com/v1/search?query=${searchTerm}&amp;per_page=${perPage}`, {\r\n    headers: {\r\n      Authorization: PEXELS_API_KEY,\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n  const data = await result.json();\r\n\r\n  const imagesContainer = document.qerySelector('#images-container');\r\n  for (const photo of data.photos) {\r\n    const img = document.createElement('image');\r\n    img.src = photo.src.medium;\r\n    imagesContainer.append(img);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfetchImages('dogs', 5);\r\nfetchImages(5, 'cats');\r\nfetchImages('puppies');\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Can you spot the issues in the above example? Of course, if you ran this code in a browser you&#8217;d immediately get errors, but by taking advantage of TypeScript we can get the errors quicker by having TypeScript spot those issues in our editor.</p>\n<p>Shortening this feedback loop is valuable — and it gets more valuable as the size of your project grows. It&#8217;s easy to spot errors in these 30 lines of code, but what if you&#8217;re working in a codebase with thousands of lines? Would you spot any potential issues easily then?</p>\n<p><em>Note: there&#8217;s no need to obtain an API key from Pexels to follow along with this TypeScript tutorial. However, if you&#8217;d like to run the code, an API key is entirely free: you just need to <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/onboarding/\">sign up for an account</a> and then generate one.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"runningtypescriptfromtheeditor\">Running TypeScript from the Editor</h2>\n<p>Once upon a time, TypeScript required that all files be written as <code>.ts</code> files. But these days, the onboarding ramp is smoother. You don&#8217;t need a TypeScript file to write TypeScript code: instead, we can run TypeScript on any JavaScript file we fancy!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a VS Code user (don&#8217;t panic if you aren&#8217;t — we&#8217;ll get to you!), this will work out the box with no extra requirements. We can enable TypeScript&#8217;s checking by adding this to the very top of our JavaScript file (it&#8217;s important that it&#8217;s the first line):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// @ts-check\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should then get some squiggly red errors in your editor that highlight our mistakes, as pictured below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630058335js-code-with-errors.png\" alt=\"TypeScript showing errors in VS Code\" /></p>\n<p>You should also see a cross in the bottom left-hand corner with a two by it. Clicking on this will reveal the problems that have been spotted.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630061099errors-in-console.jpg\" alt=\"Errors displayed in the VS Code console\" /></p>\n<p>And just because you&#8217;re not on VS Code doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t get the same experience with TypeScript highlighting errors. Most editors these days support the Language Server Protocol (commonly referred to as LSP), which is what VS Code uses to power its TypeScript integration.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s well worth searching online to find your editor and the recommended plugins to have it set up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installingandrunningtypescriptlocally\">Installing and Running TypeScript Locally</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not on VS Code, or you&#8217;d like a general solution, you can also run TypeScript on the command line. In this section, I&#8217;ll show you how.</p>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s generate a new project. This step assumes you have <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Node and npm installed upon your machine</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mkdir typescript-demo\r\ncd typescript demo\r\nnpm init -y\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, add TypeScript to your project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install --save-dev typescript\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: you could install TypeScript globally on your machine, but I like to install it per-project. That way, I ensure I have control over exactly which version of TypeScript each project uses. This is useful if you have a project you&#8217;ve not touched for a while; you can keep using an older TS version on that project, whilst having a newer project using a newer version.</em></p>\n<p>Once it&#8217;s installed, you can run the TypeScript compiler (<code>tsc</code>) to get the same errors (don&#8217;t worry about these extra flags, as we&#8217;ll talk more about them shortly):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx tsc index.js --allowJs --noEmit --target es2015\r\nindex.js:13:36 - error TS2551: Property 'qerySelector' does not exist on type 'Document'. Did you mean 'querySelector'?\r\n\r\n13   const imagesContainer = document.qerySelector('#images-container');\r\n                                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n  node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.dom.d.ts:11261:5\r\n    11261     querySelector&lt;K extends keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap&gt;(selectors: K): HTMLElementTagNameMap[K] | null;\r\n              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    'querySelector' is declared here.\r\n\r\nindex.js:16:9 - error TS2339: Property 'src' does not exist on type 'HTMLElement'.\r\n\r\n16     img.src = photo.src.medium;\r\n           ~~~\r\n\r\nFound 2 errors.\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see that TypeScript on the command line highlights the same JavaScript code errors that VS Code highlighted in the screenshot above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fixingtheerrorsinourjavascriptcode\">Fixing the Errors in Our JavaScript Code</h2>\n<p>Now that we have TypeScript up and running, let&#8217;s look at how we can understand and then rectify the errors that TypeScript is flagging.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our first error.</p>\n<h3 id=\"propertyqeryselectordoesnotexistontypedocument\">Property <code>qerySelector</code> does not exist on type <code>Document</code></h3>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">index.js:13:36 - error TS2551: Property 'qerySelector' does not exist on type 'Document'. Did you mean 'querySelector'?\r\n\r\n13   const imagesContainer = document.qerySelector('#images-container');\r\n\r\n  node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.dom.d.ts:11261:5\r\n    11261     querySelector&lt;K extends keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap&gt;(selectors: K): HTMLElementTagNameMap[K] | null;\r\n              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    'querySelector' is declared here.\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This can look quite overwhelming if you&#8217;re not used to reading TypeScript errors, so don&#8217;t panic if it looks a bit odd! TypeScript has spotted that, on line <code>13</code>, we&#8217;ve called a method <code>document.qerySelector</code>. We meant <code>document.querySelector</code> but made a mistake when typing. We would have found this out when we tried to run our code in the browser, but TypeScript is able to make us aware of it sooner.</p>\n<p>The next part where it highlights <code>lib.dom.d.ts</code> and the <code>querySelector&lt;K...&gt;</code> function is diving into more advanced TypeScript code, so don&#8217;t worry about that yet, but at a high level it&#8217;s TypeScript showing us that it understands that there&#8217;s a method called <code>querySelector</code>, and it suspects we might have wanted that.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s now zoom in on the last part of the error message above:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">index.js:13:36 - error TS2551: Property 'qerySelector' does not exist on type 'Document'. Did you mean 'querySelector'?\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Specifically, I want to look at the text <code>did not exist on type 'Document'</code>. In TypeScript (and broadly in every typed language), items have what&#8217;s called a <code>type</code>.</p>\n<p>In TypeScript, numbers like <code>1</code> or <code>2.5</code> have the type <code>number</code>, strings like <code>\"hello world\"</code> have the type <code>string</code>, and an instance of an HTML Element has the type <code>HTMLElement</code>. This is what enables TypeScript&#8217;s compiler to check that our code is sound. Once it knows the type of something, it knows what functions you can call that take that something, or what methods exist on it.</p>\n<p><em>Note: if you&#8217;d like to learn more about data types, please consult “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/typing-versus-dynamic-typing/\">Introduction to Data Types: Static, Dynamic, Strong &#038; Weak</a>”.</em></p>\n<p>In our code, TypeScript has seen that we&#8217;ve referred to <code>document</code>. This is a global variable in the browser, and TypeScript knows that and knows that it has the type of <code>Document</code>. This type documents (if you pardon the pun!) all of the methods we can call. This is why TypeScript knows that <code>querySelector</code> is a method, and that the misspelled <code>qerySelector</code> is not.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see more of these types as we go through further TypeScript tutorials<!-- link opportunity-->, but this is where all of TypeScript&#8217;s power comes from. Soon we&#8217;ll define our own types, meaning really we can extend the type system to have knowledge about all of our code and what we can and can&#8217;t do with any particular object in our codebase.</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s turn our attention to our next error, which is slightly less clear.</p>\n<h3 id=\"propertysrcdoesnotexistontypehtmlelement\">Property <code>src</code> does not exist on type <code>HTMLElement</code></h3>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">index.js:16:9 - error TS2339: Property 'src' does not exist on type 'HTMLElement'.\r\n\r\n16     img.src = photo.src.medium;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is one of those errors where sometimes you have to look slightly above the error to find the problem. We know that an HTML image element does have a <code>src</code> attribute, so why doesn&#8217;t TypeScript?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const img = document.createElement('image');\r\nimg.src = photo.src.medium;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The mistake here is on the first line: when you create a new image element, you have to call <code>document.createElement('img')</code> (because the HTML tag is <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, not <code>&lt;image&gt;</code>). Once we do that, the error goes away, because TypeScript knows that, when you call <code>document.createElement('img')</code>, you get back an element that has a <code>src</code> property. And this is all down to the <em>types</em>.</p>\n<p>When you call <code>document.createElement('div')</code>, the object returned is of the type <code>HTMLDivElement</code>. When you call <code>document.createElement('img')</code>, the object returned is of type <code>HTMLImageElement</code>. <code>HTMLImageElement</code> has a <code>src</code> property declared on it, so TypeScript knows you can call <code>img.src</code>. But <code>HTMLDivElement</code> doesn&#8217;t, so TypeScript will error.</p>\n<p>In the case of <code>document.createElement('image')</code>, because TypeScript doesn&#8217;t know about any HTML element with the tag <code>image</code>, it will return an object of type <code>HTMLElement</code> (a generic HTML element, not specific to one tag), which also lacks the <code>src</code> property.</p>\n<p>Once we fix those two mistakes and re-run TypeScript, you&#8217;ll see we get back nothing, which shows that there were no errors. If you&#8217;ve configured your editor to show errors, hopefully there are now none showing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoconfiguretypescript\">How to Configure TypeScript</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit of a pain to have to add <code>// @ts-check</code> to each file, and when we run the command in the terminal having to add those extra flags. TypeScript lets you instead enable it on a JavaScript project by creating a <code>jsconfig.json</code> file.</p>\n<p>Create <code>jsconfig.json</code> in the root directory of our project and place this inside it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"checkJs\": true,\r\n    \"noEmit\": true,\r\n    \"target\": \"es2015\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"include\": [\"*.js\"]\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This configures the TypeScript compiler (and your editor&#8217;s TS integration) to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check JavaScript files (the <code>checkJs</code> option).</li>\n<li>Assume we&#8217;re building in an ES2015 environment (the <code>target</code> option). Defaulting to ES2015 means we can use things like promises without TypeScript giving us errors.</li>\n<li>Not output any compiled files (the <code>noEmit</code> option). When you&#8217;re writing TypeScript code in TypeScript source files, you need the compiler to generate JavaScript code for you to run in the browser. As we&#8217;re writing JavaScript code that&#8217;s running in the browser, we don&#8217;t need the compiler to generate any files for us.</li>\n<li>Finally, <code>include: [\"*.js\"]</code> instructs TypeScript to look at any JavaScript file in the root directory.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now that we have this file, you can update your command-line instruction to this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx tsc -p jsconfig.json\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will run the compiler with our configuration file (the <code>-p</code> here is short for &#8220;project&#8221;), so you no longer need to pass all those flags through when running TypeScript.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/typescript-tutorial-for-beginners/?utm_source=rss\">A Step-by-Step TypeScript Tutorial for Beginners</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

It’s the most extensive online package repository, containing over one million packages. Also, it’s a command-line interface tool used by developers to manage their Node.js projects.</p>\n\n<p>Developers can easily share and update software. When developers find solutions to small but powerful problems, they submit their software to npm’s central registry. Here anybody can download the code as well as receive future updates on the ‘module’ or ‘package’. Some packages are widely used.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#how-npm-is-working\">\n  </a>\n  How npm is working?\n</h2>\n\n<p>As I mentioned, npm provides us command-line interface tool so it provides such important commands to use (add a dependency) in our project.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Install package.json dependencies</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ npm install or npm i\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>npm, install downloads a package and its dependencies. npm install can be run with or without arguments.</p>\n\n<p>if you run without arguments, npm install downloads dependencies defined in a <a href=\"https://npm.github.io/how-npm-works-docs/theory-and-design/what-is-a-package.html\">**package.json</a>** file and generates a <strong>node_modules</strong> folder with the installed modules.</p>\n\n<p>npm, install also generates a <strong>package-lock.json</strong> file. This file describes the exact dependency tree that was installed. This makes it easier for subsequent installs to use the exact same tree.</p>\n\n<p>if you run with arguments, npm install downloads specific modules to the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder. and add dependency in package.json file and package-lock.json.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ npm i &lt;packag&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#options-for-installing-packages\">\n  </a>\n  Options for installing packages.\n</h2>\n\n<p>npm install can be run with different options. Here are some of the more important ones to be aware of.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) npm install (with — global)</strong></p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ npm install -g\nor\n$ npm install --global\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>if you run with — global or -g, npm install installs the package globally. This means the package is installed in two places. The first is at the root directory where <strong>package.json</strong> is defined. The second is the global <strong>node_modules</strong> folder on the user system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2) npm install (with — save)</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>npm install &lt;package&gt; --save\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>if you run with — save, npm install modifies the <strong>package.json</strong> file to include the specified package as a dependency. In this case, the package will be added as a dependency to package.json. The — save option is important whenever you want future installs to include the specified package.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3) npm install (with — save-dev)</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>npm install &lt;package&gt; --save-dev\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The — save-dev flag specifies that the package should be added to the devDependencies section of the <strong>package.json</strong> rather than the dependencies section.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other few Commands which is useful when you deal with npm.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>List globally installed packages</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>npm list -g --depth=0\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Uninstall global package</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>npm -g uninstall &lt;package&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Update global packages</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>npm outdated -g --depth=0\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>List available scripts to run</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>npm run\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Update npm</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>npm install -g npm@latest\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#types-of-npm-package\">\n  </a>\n  Types of npm package:\n</h2>\n\n<p>There are two types of npm packages.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>private</p></li>\n<li><p>public</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#private-packages\">\n  </a>\n  Private packages\n</h2>\n\n<p>With npm private packages, you can use the npm registry to host code that is only visible to you and your chosen collaborators, allowing you to manage and use private code alongside public code in your projects. <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/about-private-packages\">see more</a></p>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#public-packages\">\n  </a>\n  Public Packages\n</h2>\n\n<p>As an npm user or organization member, you can create and publish public packages that anyone can download and use in their own projects. <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/about-public-packages\">see more</a></p>\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#create-and-publish-public-packages\">\n  </a>\n  Create and Publish Public packages\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">https://www.npmjs.com/</a> and create a new account If you don’t already have an account.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Create Project if you don’t already have a project.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ mkdir publish-npm-test\n$ cd publish-npm-test\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Open terminal and hit npm init command</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ npm init\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This command will help you to create a new package.json and it will ask you for the basic information which will be useful to publish the package.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Now add proper detail to your project.</p>\n\n<p>Package name: guidelines of npm docs for the package name. ex. publish-npm-test</p>\n\n<p>Version: you will be advised to start your project with version 1.0.0, however, if you are just starting your project you’re probably better off starting with something like 0.0.1 and switching to 1.0.0 when the code has been tested further. Also, other developers using your library will appreciate that your versioning reflects the state of your code.</p>\n\n<p>Git repository: Add the link to your git repository if you have.</p>\n\n<p>Description: it should be straight to the point and easy to understand.</p>\n\n<p>Entry point: This is the entry file for your library. default index.js</p>\n\n<p>keywords: it can help

published by the Internet Software Consortium, nowadays called Internet Systems Consortium (<strong>ISC</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>Now Your Package.json file is ready.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Create an index.js file</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>console.log(\"my first npm package\");\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Testing the created npm package using require statement.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you are done with creating the npm package but before publishing it to the npm repository, you need to make sure it works when you use it</p>\n\n<p>using require or import statement.</p>\n\n<p>go to the publish-npm-test directory.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ npm link\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Executing npm link the command creates a symbolic link for your current package inside the global npm node_modules folder (The same folder where our global npm dependencies get installed).</p>\n\n<p>Now, create a test directory, for testing our package.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ mkdir test-package \n$ cd test-package \n$ npm init -y\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>the name property in our package’s package.json file was publish-npm-test so you need to require the package using the same name.</p>\n\n<p>Now, execute the following command from inside the test-package folder to use the package you created:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ npm link publish-npm-test\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Create a new file with the name index.js and add the following code inside it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>require(\"publish-npm-test\");\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Now, execute the index.js file.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>node index.js\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>You will see the output displayed:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>my first npm package\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Now, when you publish the npm package on the npm repository, anyone can use it by installing it and using the require or import statement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Publish to the npm repository.</p>\n\n<p>Open terminal and from inside the publish-npm-test folder execute the following command:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ npm whoami\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>if you are already login you will see your username.</p>\n\n<p>if you are not logged in then hit the following command.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ npm

their projects, we recommend including a README file in your package directory. Your README file may include directions for installing, configuring and using the code in your package, as well as any other information a user may find helpful.</p>\n\n<p>readMe.md</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code># This is Sample Test Package.\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Now, Let’s try to publish it again using the npm publish command.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>$ npm publish\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HvSJVWSM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2216/0%2AcE2cyWXBI6A5yV24.jpg\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HvSJVWSM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2216/0%2AcE2cyWXBI6A5yV24.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"880\" height=\"222\"></a></p>\n\n<p>It’ll give an error.

It might have outdated dependencies which can cause maintainability issues. It can also have tests that are flaky and don’t inspire any confidence. There can also be issues with large JavaScript and CSS bundles causing the application to provide a non-optimal user experience for the end-users.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are a few ways in which you can make a large code-base easy to maintain. In this article, we will discuss a few of those techniques as well as some of the things I wish I had known earlier to help manage large Next.js applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>While this article is specific to Next.js, some of the points will also work for a wide variety of front-end applications.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-typescript\">Use TypeScript</h2>\n\n<p>TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language which means that it enforces certain strictness while intermixing different types of data. According to <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021\">StackOverflow Developer Survey 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a> is one of the languages that developers want to work with the most.</p>\n\n<p>Using a strongly typed language like TypeScript will help a lot when working with a large codebase. It will help you understand if there is a possibility that your application will break when there is a change. It is not guaranteed that TypeScript will always complain when there is a chance of breakage. However, most of the time, TypeScript will help you <strong>eliminate bugs even before you build your application</strong>. In certain cases, the build will fail if there are type mismatches in your code as Next.js checks for type definition during build time.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript\">the Next.js docs</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>“By default, Next.js will do type checking as part of the next build. We recommend using code editor type checking during development.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that <code>next build</code> is the script that creates an optimized production build of your Next.js application. From my personal experience, it helped me a lot when I was trying to <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11#upgrade-guide\">update Next.js to version 11</a> for one of my applications. As a part of that update, I also decided to update a few other packages. Because of TypeScript and VSCode, I was able to figure out when those breaking changes even before I had built the application.</p>\n\n<div data-audience=\"non-subscriber\" data-remove=\"true\" class=\"feature-panel-container\"><span class=\"feature-panel__desc\">More after jump!

You might want to keep the library in a separate repository to add new components, build and release them as a package. This seems clean and works fine when you want to work in the library. But when you want to integrate the library in your Next.js application, <strong>the development experience will suffer</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This is because when you integrate the component library with your Next.js application, you might have to go back into the library’s repository, make changes, release the updates and then install the new version in your Next.js application. Only after that, the new changes from the component library will start reflecting in the Next.js application. Imagine your whole team doing this multiple times. The amount of time spent on building and releasing the component library separately will add up to a huge chunk.</p>\n\n<p>This problem can be resolved if you <strong>use a mono-repo structure where your component library resides with your Next.js application</strong>. In this case, you can simply update your component library and it will immediately reflect in your Next.js application. There is no need for a separate build and release of your component library.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a package like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules\">next-transpile-modules</a> so that you don’t even need to build your component library before your Next.js application can consume it. However, if you are planning to release your component library as an npm package, you might need to have a build step.</p>\n\n<p>For managing a mono-repo, you can use tools like <a href=\"https://lerna.js.org/\">Lerna</a>, <a href=\"https://nx.dev/\">Nx</a>, <a href=\"https://rushjs.io/\">Rush</a>, <a href=\"https://turborepo.com/\">Turborepo</a>, <a href=\"https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/\">yarn workspaces</a>, or <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces\">npm workspaces</a>. I liked using Lerna together with yarn workspaces when I needed to configure my build pipeline. If you prefer something which will automate a bunch of things via CLI, you can take a look at Nx. I feel that all of them are good but solve slightly different problems.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-code-generators-like-hygen-to-generate-boilerplate-code\">Use Code Generators Like Hygen To Generate Boilerplate Code</h2>\n\n<p>When a lot of developers start contributing to a large code-base, there is a good chance that there will be a lot of duplicate code. This happens mainly because there is a need to build a page, component, or utility function which is similar to an already existing one with slight modifications.</p>\n\n<p>You can think of <strong>writing unit test cases</strong> for your components or utility functions. You might want to copy the boilerplate code as much as possible and do certain modifications as per the new file. However, this adds a lot of code consisting of bad variable naming in your code-base. This can be reduced by a proper code-review process. However, there is a better way to reduce this by automating the generation of the boilerplate code.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you are using <a href=\"https://nx.dev/latest/react/getting-started/nx-cli\">Nx</a>, you will need to have a way in which you can automate a lot of code generation. I have used <a href=\"https://www.hygen.io/\">Hygen</a> to generate the boilerplate code for Redux, React components, and utility functions. You can check out the <a href=\"https://www.hygen.io/docs/quick-start\">documentation</a> to get started with Hygen. They also have <a href=\"https://www.hygen.io/docs/redux\">a dedicated section</a> for generating Redux boilerplate. You can also use <a href=\"https://redux-toolkit.js.org/\">Redux Toolkit</a> to reduce the boilerplate code necessary for your Redux applications. We will discuss this package next.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-a-well-established-pattern-like-redux-with-lesser-boilerplate-via-redux-toolkit\">Use A Well-Established Pattern Like Redux With Lesser Boilerplate Via Redux Toolkit</h2>\n\n<p>Many developers will argue that <a href=\"https://redux.js.org/\">Redux</a> increases the complexity of the code-base or <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html\">React Context</a> is much easier to maintain. I think that it depends mostly on the type of application that you are building as well as the expertise of the whole development team. You can choose whatever state management solution your team is most comfortable with, but try to choose one that doesn’t need to have a lot of boilerplate.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, I’m mentioning Redux because it is still <a href=\"https://www.npmtrends.com/mobx-vs-redux-vs-zustand-vs-xstate\">the most popular state management solution</a> out there according to npm trends. In the case of Redux, you can reduce a lot of boilerplate code by using <a href=\"https://redux-toolkit.js.org/\">Redux Toolkit</a>. This is a very opinionated and powerful library that you can use to <strong>simplify your state management</strong>. Check out their <a href=\"https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started\">documentation</a> regarding how to get started with Redux Toolkit.</p>\n\n<p>I have used Redux, <a href=\"https://zustand.surge.sh/\">Zustand</a>, and Redux Toolkit while building Next.js applications. I feel that Zustand is very simple and easy to understand. However, I still use Redux in case I need to build something complex. I haven’t used <a href=\"https://xstate.js.org/\">XState</a> but it is also a popular choice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-react-query-or-swr-for-fetching-async-data\">Use React Query Or SWR For Fetching Async Data</h2>\n\n<p>Most front-end applications will fetch data from a back-end server and render it on the page. In a Next.js application or any JavaScript application, you can fetch data using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API\">the Fetch API</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios\">Axios</a>, or similar libraries. However, as the application grows, it becomes very difficult to manage this async state of your data. You might create your abstractions using utility functions or wrappers around Fetch or Axios but when multiple developers are working on the same application, these utility functions or wrappers will soon become difficult to manage. Your application might also suffer from caching, and performance issues.</p>\n\n<p>To resolve these kinds of issues, it is better to use packages like <a href=\"https://react-query.tanstack.com/\">React Query</a> or <a href=\"https://swr.vercel.app/\">SWR</a>. These packages provide <strong>a default set of configurations out of the box</strong>. They handle a lot of things like caching and performance which are difficult to manage on your own. Both of these packages provide some <a href=\"https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/important-defaults\">default configuration</a> and <a href=\"https://swr.vercel.app/docs/options\">options</a> which you can use to customize their behaviors according to the requirements of your application. These packages will fetch and cache async data from your back-end API endpoints and make your application state much more maintainable.</p>\n\n<p>I have used both React Query and SWR in my projects and I like both of them. You can take a look at <a href=\"https://react-query.tanstack.com/comparison#_top\">their comparison</a> and features to decide which one you should use.</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-commitizen-and-semantic-release-with-husky\">Use Commitizen And Semantic Release With Husky</h2>\n\n<p>If you deploy and release your application often, then you might have encountered issues with versioning. When you are working on a big application and multiple developers are contributing to it, managing releases becomes even more difficult. It becomes very difficult to keep track of the changelog. Manually updating the changelog becomes very difficult and slowly your changelog becomes out of date.</p>\n\n<p>You can combine packages like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen\">Commitizen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release\">Semantic Release</a> to help you with versioning and maintaining a changelog. These tools help you in <strong>automating part of your release process by keeping the changelog in sync</strong> with what changes were deployed in a particular release. You can use a tool like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky\">Husky</a> to ensure that all the contributors are following the established pattern for writing commit messages and helping you in managing your changelog.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-storybook-for-visualizing-ui-components\">Use Storybook For Visualizing UI Components</h2>\n\n<p>In a large code-base, your application will most likely consist of a lot of components. Some of these components will be outdated, buggy, or not necessary anymore. However, it is very difficult to keep track of this kind of thing in a large application. Developers might create new components whose behavior might be similar to an already existing component because they don’t know that the previous component exists. This happens often because there is no way to keep track of what components the application currently has and how they interact with each other.</p>\n\n<p>Tools like <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">Storybook</a> will help you <strong>keep track of all the components that your code-base currently consists of</strong>. <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/examples\">Setting up Storybook</a> is easy and can integrate with your existing Next.js application. Next.js has <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-storybook\">an example</a> that shows how to set up Storybook with your application.</p>\n\n<p>I have always liked using Storybook because it helps my team of developers understand how each component behaves and what APIs it exposes. It serves as a source of documentation for every developer. Storybook also helps designers understand the behavior of all the components and interactions. You can also use <a href=\"https://www.chromatic.com/\">Chromatic</a> along with Storybook for visual testing and catching regression issues during each release.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong>: <em>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/building-react-apps-storybook/\">Building React Apps With Storybook</a>” by Abdulazeez Adeshina</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"write-maintainable-tests-from-the-start\">Write Maintainable Tests From The Start</h2>\n\n<p>Writing tests consumes time. As a result, many companies tend not to invest time in writing any sort of test. Because of this, the application might suffer in the long run. As the application grows, the complexity of the application also increases. In a complex application, refactoring becomes difficult because it is very hard to understand which files might break because of the changes.</p>\n\n<p>One solution to this problem would be to <strong>write as many tests</strong> as possible from the start. You can follow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#:~:text=Test%2Ddriven%20development%20(TDD),software%20against%20all%20test%20cases.\">Test Driven Development (or TDD)</a> or any other similar concept that works for you. There is an excellent article <a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-testing-trophy-and-testing-classifications\"><em>The Testing Trophy and Testing Classifications</em></a> by Kent C. Dodds which talks about different types of tests that you can write.</p>\n\n<p>Although writing maintainable tests take time. But I think that tests are very essential for large applications as it gives developers the confidence to refactor files. Generally, I use <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest</a>, <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro\">React Testing Library</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cypress.io/\">Cypress</a> for writing tests in my application.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-dependabot-to-update-packages-automatically\">Use Dependabot To Update Packages Automatically</h2>\n\n<p>When multiple feature teams contribute to the same application, there is a good chance that the packages used in it will become outdated. This happens because if there are any breaking changes while updating packages, there is a possibility that a considerable amount of time needs to be invested in doing that update. This might result in missing deadlines for shipping features. However, this practice might hurt in the long run. Working with outdated packages can cause a lot of issues like security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, tools like <a href=\"https://dependabot.com/\">Dependabot</a> can <strong>help your team by automating the update process</strong>. Dependabot can be <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#about-the-dependabotyml-file\">configured</a> to check for outdated packages and send updated pull requests as often as you need. Using tools like Dependabot has helped me a lot in keeping the dependencies of my applications updated.</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"things-i-wish-i-had-known-earlier\">Things I Wish I Had Known Earlier</h2>\n\n<p>There are many things that I wish I had known earlier while building the Next.js application. However, the most important is the going to the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/going-to-production\">Production section of the Next.js documentation</a>. This section outlines some of the most important things that one should implement <strong>before deploying a Next.js application to production</strong>. Before I read this section, I used to arbitrarily guess about what to do before deploying any application to production.</p>\n\n<p>Always check what browsers you need to support before deploying your application to production and shipping them to your customers. <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/supported-browsers-features\">Next.js supports a wide range of browsers</a>. But it is essential to understand what type of users you are shipping your application to and what type of browsers they use.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>These are some of the things that I learned while building and maintaining a large Next.js application. Most of these points will apply to any front-end application. For any front-end application, the main priority should always be shipping a product that has a very good user experience, is fast, and feels smooth to use.</p>\n\n<p>I try to keep all these points in mind whenever I develop any application. I hope that they’ll prove to be useful to you, too!</p>\n\n<div class=\"signature\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/logo/logo--red.png\" alt=\"Smashing Editorial\" width=\"35\" height=\"46\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" />\n  <span>(vf, yk, il)</span>\n</div>\n\n\n              </article>\n            </body>\n          </html>\n        "

Marketing attracts leads, leads become customers, and customers provide profit. Unfortunately, outreach, networking, and search engine optimization all play a role in marketing — and it doesn’t take long to realize that you’re looking at a sizable workload on top of everything else you’re doing to grow your business.</strong> </p>\n<p>Luckily, thanks to new technology, you can now automate parts of the process to help decrease workload and drive real efficiency. In this article, we’ll go over several ways you can use automation to increase web traffic and improve your workflows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharenewcontentonsocialmedia\">Share New Content on Social Media</h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/\">3.6 billion users</a> worldwide, social media platforms have experienced incredible growth over the years, and they show no signs of slowing down.</p>\n<p>While they were first used for entertainment and socialization, they have now become one of the primary marketing channels. Predictably, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/203513/usage-trands-of-social-media-platforms-in-marketing/\">92% of marketers</a> use social media as part of their growth strategy.</p>\n<p>A well developed and structured social media marketing plan can help you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>generate web traffic from backlinks</li>\n<li>build trust with your audience</li>\n<li>increase brand awareness</li>\n<li>reach a wider audience</li>\n<li>grow your online following</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each social media platform will have a different demographic, so you should tailor your content for the platforms you want to focus on. For instance, your awesome 20-second video might be a hit on TikTok but a complete fail on Instagram and Facebook.  </p>\n<p>Posting manually on each platform is extremely time-consuming, to the point where it might not even be worth the <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/really-measure-roi-social-efforts/\">return on investment</a>. Luckily, there are several tools you can use to automate content publishing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"integratecontentcalwithzapier\">Integrate ContentCal with Zapier</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.contentcal.io/\">ContentCal</a> is a marketing planning tool that helps you plan and create content. When you pair it with a tool like Zapier — which helps you automate repetitive tasks between two or more apps — you can automatically post content from ContentCal to social platforms.</p>\n<p>For example, after you’ve set up ContentCal with your desired social media platforms, once you add a new post to your schedule, this post could generate Instagram posts, Pinterest pins, and Facebook updates automatically. All of these can be unique to each platform without any extra work on your part.</p>\n<p>However, an integration with ContentCal isn’t limited to publishing content and pushing it out to different places. You can also bring content from outside into ContentCal. For example, if your team uses Slack internally and has been discussing some new ideas, you can easily pull those into ContentCal. </p>\n<p>Connecting ContentCal with Zapier is a fairly simple process. Once you’ve created an account with both of these services, you can check out Zapier’s list of pre-made <a href=\"https://zapier.com/apps/contentcal/integrations\">ContentCal integrations</a> and click “Try it” to begin testing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"senddatatogooglesheets\">Send Data to Google Sheets</h2>\n<p>Google Sheets is a powerful free tool that allows you to organize and manipulate big data sets, create semi-automated <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-to-wordpress-seo/\">SEO</a> workflows, and much more. </p>\n<p>A great way Google Sheets can improve your SEO workflow is by allowing you to import keyword and search volume data from your SEO tool so you can manipulate it more easily. </p>\n<p>Plus, exporting data from SEO tools is also great for startups with small budgets that don’t want another monthly expense. For example, you can sign up for a free trial or pay for only one month of use and export all the data you need. </p>\n<p>However, without the right formulas ready, you could spend endless hours sorting, merging, splitting, adding, deleting, and searching for data. One of the most basic, yet useful formulas is the <code>IF</code> function.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usingtheiffunction\">Using the IF function</h3>\n<p>The <code>IF</code> function in Google Sheets can be used when you want to check if a certain condition is true or false for a list of data in your spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>The syntax looks like this: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>condition</code> is what you’re testing to be true or false. If it’s true, <code>value_if_true</code> is what will be displayed. If it’s false, <code>value_if_false</code> will be displayed instead.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you’ve imported a list of keywords and their search volume to Google Sheets but only want to work with keywords that can bring 500+ visitors per month.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1624994391Keyword-Analysis-Google-Sheets-Example.jpg\" alt=\"Example of a list on keywords on Google Sheets\" /></p>\n<p>You can set the <code>IF</code> function to return <code>YES</code> for keywords that could bring 500+ visitors per month and <code>NO</code> for the rest:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">=IF(B2&gt;500,\"YES\",\"NO\")\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1624994396Keyword-Google-Sheets-Automation-IF-Function.jpg\" alt=\"Keyword Google Sheets automation IF function\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"usingarrayformula\">Using ARRAYFORMULA</h3>\n<p>If you’re working with a large dataset, it will be a hassle to drag formulas down across thousands of cells. This is where ARRAYFORMULA comes in handy.</p>\n<p>The syntax looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">=ARRAYFORMULA(array_formula)\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This allows you to type in your formula once and then apply it to an entire row or column. Simply replace <code>array_formula</code> with the formula you’d like to replicate. In our case, it would be the <code>IF</code> function formula. Just remember to include your first and last cells in the formula. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1624994394Keyword-Google-Sheets-Automation-ARRAYFORMULA.jpg\" alt=\"ARRAYFORMULA example\" /></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/increase-web-traffic-using-automation/?utm_source=rss\">Using Automation to Increase Web Traffic</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Enter Bubble, a visual programming language that lets you build web applications using a drag-and-drop editor.</strong></p>\n<p>In this article, I’ll be introducing you to Bubble. You’ll learn what it is, what features it offers, and what sort of web applications you can build with it. Then we’ll compare it to traditional web application development and examine the pros and cons of using Bubble. Lastly, we’ll build an app using Bubble so you can get a feel for how to build stuff with it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisbubble\">What is Bubble?</h2>\n<p>Bubble is both a visual programming tool and a platform. You build the application using a drag-and-drop interface in the browser, and then Bubble acts as the platform that serves your application. This means that everything you need to build a web application is in your web browser. Bubble takes care of all the setup and provisioning required to run a web application.</p>\n<p>Bubble is geared towards both coders and non-coders alike. But it mostly appeals to non-coders who want to build web applications without knowing the traditional tools of trade. </p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<p>Bubble is packed with <a href=\"https://bubble.io/feature-index\">lots of features</a>. We can’t cover all of them here, but we’ll try to cover the most important ones.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>UI Builder</strong>. With Bubble’s UI builder, you can drag and drop visual elements such as text, images, icons, maps, videos and other common UI elements into its canvas. Web apps created with Bubble incorporate responsive design and can be easily localized to any language.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hosting platform</strong>. After you build the app using the drag-and-drop UI builder, Bubble takes care of deploying and hosting the app for you. It also has a version control system that allows you to revert your application to any point in time. Bubble also allows you to easily scale the app as the need arises. You&#8217;l know when it’s time to upgrade, because Bubble has graphs on the server metrics such as page views and server capacity usage. The only downside to Bubble being a platform is that you can’t host the app you built with Bubble on your own server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Plugins</strong>. With <a href=\"https://bubble.io/plugins\">plugins</a>, you can integrate functionality from various tools around the Web into your web application. For example, if you want your users to log in with their Facebook account, you can do so with the <a href=\"https://bubble.io/integration/facebook\">Facebook plugin</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Realtime collaboration</strong>. Bubble is team-friendly. It allows up to 40 collaborators.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ll only be covering the UI builder in this article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatyoucanbuildwithbubble\">What You Can Build with Bubble</h2>\n<p>Due to its flexibility, you can build any type of web application with Bubble. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CRUD apps</strong>. These are apps that let users create, read, update, and delete data. Most apps today are really just CRUD apps with different features added to it. So with the ability to build CRUD apps, you can already build all kinds of functionality. Think Amazon or YouTube. At their core, they’re really just CRUD apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Realtime apps</strong>. These are apps that let users communicate or collaborate in real time, either via chat, audio, video call, or a shared interface. Examples of these apps include Messenger, Discord, and Slack.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>API-connected app</strong>. The idea that “no man is an island” applies to apps as well. With Bubble, you can build apps that make use of third-party APIs all around the Internet. Think <a href=\"https://stripe.com/\">Stripe</a> for handling payments, or <a href=\"https://www.algolia.com/\">Algolia</a> for handling search. The possibilities are endless with API access. Through an API, you can provide any type of functionality that’s not already provided by Bubble. It also goes the other way around: the apps you create using Bubble can also expose an API that can be used by others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Responsive apps</strong>. These are apps that look good no matter what device you’re viewing them on. With Bubble, you get this for free, as the apps you build with it are already responsive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Progressive web apps</strong>. These are web apps that can be added to your home screen for easy access. They won’t have access to native functionality that’s available to native Android or iOS apps, but they can be accessed from the home screen and they can work offline. So it’s the closest thing you can get to a native app. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to see live examples of apps that you can build with Bubble, check out their <a href=\"https://bubble.io/showcase\">showcase page</a>. You can also check out their <a href=\"https://bubble.io/how-to-build\">how to build</a> page to see a tutorial on how to build apps like Instagram, Dropbox, or TripAdvisor. Do note that these aren&#8217;t super detailed tutorials; they&#8217;re just general ones to give you an idea of the general steps for building those kinds of apps. You’ll still need some level of proficiency in using Bubble to be able to build those apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatcantbebuiltwithbubble\">What Can’t be Built with Bubble</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Native apps</strong>. At the time of writing this article, Bubble doesn’t support building native apps that run on Android or iOS. Bubble says in <a href=\"https://manual.bubble.io/new-start-here/the-basics\">its documentation</a> that there’s a plan to add this feature to the core functionality, but it’s not on Bubble&#8217;s timeline yet. So we don’t really know when it will become available. For now, the only feasible option is to either create a progressive web app or wrap the web app in a web view using tools like React Native, Flutter, or Cordova.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Games</strong>. If you’re planning to build games and other apps with complex graphics requirements with Bubble, you’re out of luck. Bubble is specifically made for creating web apps. You can probably get away with creating simple puzzle games, but that’s it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"bubblevstraditionalwebapplicationdevelopment\">Bubble vs Traditional Web Application Development</h2>\n<p>In this section, we’ll look at how Bubble compares to the traditional way of developing web applications, based on these metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>control over code and data</li>\n<li>development speed</li>\n<li>development cost</li>\n<li>running costs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"controlovercodeanddata\">Control over code and data</h3>\n<p>Bubble has a data export feature that allows you to export user-created data via CSV files. The only downside is that everything runs on Bubble&#8217;s platform, so you can’t really export your app and run it somewhere else. <a href=\"https://manual.bubble.io/new-start-here/application-and-data-ownership#exporting-your-application-and-data\">Bubble has guaranteed to release the source code of your app</a> under an open-source license in case it goes out of business.  </p>\n<p>With traditional web development, you have control over everything, since the source code is written from scratch and it’s hosted on a server of your choice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"developmentspeed\">Development speed</h3>\n<p>Bubble comes with all the tools you need to build a web application via a drag-and-drop interface. This makes the development process faster than traditional web development. That said, it also comes with a learning curve that&#8217;s dependent on the thing you want to build. If it’s a simple one-page app that only does one or two things, it’s probably going to take a few hours to learn. But if it’s a fairly complex app, expect to invest one to three months before you can become productive enough to build the app quickly. </p>\n<p>With traditional web development, it can take at least three months to learn the technologies and tools. But it can easily take six months to a year depending on various factors. Once that’s done, however, you can expect to be productive with building most apps. </p>\n<p>Overall, the development speed will mostly depend on your level of experience. If you’re a complete novice, Bubble will be faster. If you already have some development experience, it’s usually faster to just build your app via the traditional route. Yes, your development experience will probably help with a lot of the concepts in building apps with Bubble. But the learning curve for building fairly complex apps will still be great.</p>\n<h3 id=\"developmentcost\">Development cost</h3>\n<p>With Bubble, you can pretty much build the app yourself, even if you have no prior experience. Bubble provides lots of free resources for learning how to build different kinds of apps. Of course, you can hire other people to do it for you. But the main premise of Bubble (and other no-code platforms in general) is for lowering the development costs by doing the development yourself.</p>\n<p>With traditional web development, you&#8217;ll most likely have to hire a web developer to build the app for you, due to the steep learning curve involved.</p>\n<p>Overall, the associated development costs when developing your app with Bubble is significantly lowered compared to traditional development. </p>\n<h3 id=\"runningcosts\">Running costs</h3>\n<p>Bubble starts with a free plan. This allows you to learn the platform and build an app with it. Bubble&#8217;s personal plan will be used mostly for staging and testing purposes. Once you’re ready to launch your app, you’ll have to switch to either professional or production plans. You can checkout out Bubble&#8217;s <a href=\"https://bubble.io/pricing/compare\">pricing page</a> for more info on what you get with each plan.</p>\n<p>Bubble has a concept called “units”, which are basically reserved server capacity for scaling up. Additional units are needed once your app acquires a certain amount of active users. Aside from that, another limiting factor is the file storage. Each plan has a total file storage allotment assigned to it. So you’ll most likely meet the ceiling sooner if your app stores a lot of user-uploaded media. There are plugins available for handling file storage, but those are going to cost additional per month.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, running your app via the traditional way will cost as little as $5 per month for the server. The only downside is that you have to set up everything from scratch — things like the web server, database, and queue server. Realistically speaking, you won’t just be paying $5 per month, since you also have to bring in file storage, error reporting, and deployment services. Those can easily increase your total running costs.</p>\n<p>Overall, the costs associated with running your app will be highly dependent on the services you need to pull in and the server capacity you need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildinganappwithbubble\">Building an App with Bubble</h2>\n<p>For you to get a feel of what it’s like to build apps with Bubble, we’ll be creating a simple CRUD app with it. Before proceeding, you first need to create a <a href=\"https://bubble.io/\">Bubble account</a>. </p>\n<p>Once you have an account, create a new app.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631011880create-bubble-app.png\" alt=\"Create a new app\" /></p>\n<p>Once the app is created, the new application assistant will prompt you to get started. Click the <strong>Start with a blank page</strong> button and close the assistant. I don’t know about you, but I always prefer to start from scratch. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631011878start-blank.png\" alt=\"New application assistant\" /></p>\n<p>Now that we have an app, let’s quickly go over what we’re going to build.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Authentication feature</strong>. This will allow the user to log in to the system.</li>\n<li><strong>Product CRUD</strong>. CRUD is an acronym that describes an app capable of handling the most important database functions for interactivity, and stands for “create, read, update, and delete” — basically allowing the user to maintain product data in a database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We&#8217;ve chosen these two features to show just how effectively Bubble can handle app logic, and ensure this guide teaches you all the concepts you might need to bring your own ideas to life in Bubble.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uibasics\">UI basics</h3>\n<p>Before we proceed to actually building the app, it’s important to get yourself familiar with the UI first.<br />\n<img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631011876blank-app.png\" alt=\"Blank app screen\" /></p>\n<p>The <strong>Design</strong> tab is where you&#8217;ll usually start. As Bubble is a visual programming language, it always starts with the UI. The <strong>Design</strong> tab contains a list of visual elements that you can drag or click and draw (click the element to select it, release, then draw the element) to the canvas. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631011874design-tab.png\" alt=\"Design tab\" /></p>\n<p>Next is the <strong>Workflow</strong> tab. This is where you&#8217;ll find all the workflows for a specific page. In Bubble, you use workflows to specify what the app does when a certain event happens. For example, when the <strong>Log in</strong> button is clicked, we want to log the user in to the app, clear out the form, then redirect the user to the admin page if the credentials are correct.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631011873workflow-tab.png\" alt=\"Workflow tab\" /></p>\n<p>The workflows are displayed only per page and not the whole app, so you have to click on the dropdown on the upper left to select which page you want to add a workflow to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631011871workflow-page.png\" alt=\"Workflow page dropdown\" /></p>\n<p>The <strong>Data</strong> tab is where you&#8217;ll see the app’s database, the tables within it, and the data within each table. It also comes with a data manager that allows you to perform CRUD operations on each row.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631011869data-tab.png\" alt=\"Data tab\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to edit the columns for each table, you can do so in the <strong>Data types</strong> tab.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631011867data-types.png\" alt=\"Data types tab\" /></p>\n<p>Lastly, we have the <strong>Styles</strong> tab. This is where you can customize the app’s overall theme. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631011864styles-tab.png\" alt=\"Styles tab\" /></p>\n<p>There are three other tabs we haven’t gone through: plugins, settings, and logs. We won’t really go over those since we won&#8217;t be using them in the app we’re building here.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/bubble-build-apps-no-code/?utm_source=rss\">Get Started with Bubble, a No-code Tool for Building Serious Apps</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

It would be a waste of time to reinvent the wheel in your own code when someone else has already written a wonderful solution. That&#8217;s why so many projects use third-party code in the form of libraries or modules.</strong></p>\n<p>Git, the world&#8217;s most popular version control system, offers a great way to manage these dependencies in an elegant, robust way. Its &#8220;submodule&#8221; concept allows us to include and manage third-party libraries while keeping them cleanly separated from our own code.</p>\n<p>In this article, you&#8217;ll learn why submodules in Git are so useful, what they actually are, and how they work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keepingcodeseparate\">Keeping Code Separate</h2>\n<p>To make clear why Git&#8217;s submodules are indeed an invaluable structure, let&#8217;s look at a case <em>without</em> submodules. When you need to include third-party code (such as an open-source library) you can of course go the easy way: just download the code from GitHub and dump it somewhere into your project. While certainly <em>quick</em>, this approach is definitely <em>dirty</em> for a couple of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By brute force copying third-party code into your project, you&#8217;re effectively mixing multiple projects into one. The line between your own project and that of someone else (the library) starts to get blurry.</li>\n<li>Whenever you need to update the library code (because its maintainer delivered a great new feature or fixed a nasty bug) you again have to download, copy, and paste. This quickly becomes a tedious process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The general rule in software development to &#8220;keep separate things separate&#8221; exists for a reason. And it&#8217;s certainly true for managing third-party code in your own projects. Luckily, Git&#8217;s submodule concept was made for exactly these situations.</p>\n<p>But of course, submodules aren&#8217;t the only available solution for this kind of problem. You could also use one of the various &#8220;package manager&#8221; systems that many modern languages and frameworks provide. And there&#8217;s nothing wrong about that!</p>\n<p>However, you could argue that Git&#8217;s submodule architecture comes with a couple of advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submodules provide a consistent, reliable interface — no matter what language or framework you&#8217;re using. Especially if you&#8217;re working with multiple technologies, each one might have its own package manager with its own set of rules and commands. Submodules, on the other hand, always work the same.</li>\n<li>Not every piece of code might be available over a package manager. Maybe you just want to share your own code between two projects — a situation where submodules might offer the simplest possible workflow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whatgitsubmodulesreallyare\">What Git Submodules Really Are</h2>\n<p>Submodules in Git are really just standard Git repositories. No fancy innovation, just the same Git repositories that we all know so well by now. This is also part of the power of submodules: they&#8217;re so robust and straightforward because they are so &#8220;boring&#8221; (from a technological point of view) and field-tested.</p>\n<p>The only thing that makes a Git repository a submodule is that it&#8217;s placed <em>inside</em> another, <em>parent</em> Git repository.</p>\n<p>Other than that, a Git submodule remains a fully functional repository: you can perform all the actions that you already know from your &#8220;normal&#8221; Git work — from modifying files, all the way to committing, pulling and pushing. Everything&#8217;s possible in a submodule.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addingasubmodule\">Adding a Submodule</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take the classic example and say we&#8217;d like to add a third-party library to our project. Before we go get any code, it makes sense to create a separate folder where things like these can have a home:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ mkdir lib\r\n$ cd lib\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we&#8217;re ready to pump some third-party code into our project — but in an orderly fashion, using submodules. Let&#8217;s say we need a little &#8220;timezone converter&#8221; JavaScript library:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ git submodule add https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime.git\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we run this command, Git starts cloning the repository into our project, as a submodule:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">Cloning into 'carparts-website/lib/spacetime'...\r\nremote: Enumerating objects: 7768, done.\r\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (1066/1066), done.\r\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (445/445), done.\r\nremote: Total 7768 (delta 615), reused 975 (delta 588), pack-reused 6702\r\nReceiving objects: 100% (7768/7768), 4.02 MiB | 7.78 MiB/s, done.\r\nResolving deltas: 100% (5159/5159), done.\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>And if we take a look at our working copy folder, we can see that the library files have in fact arrived in our project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631605297finder-after-cloning-submodule.png\" alt=\"Our library files are here, included in a submodule\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;So what&#8217;s the difference?&#8221; you might ask. After all, the third-party library&#8217;s files are here, just like they would be if we had copy-pasted them. The crucial difference is indeed that they are <em>contained in their own Git repository</em>! Had we just downloaded some files, thrown them into our project and then committed them — like the other files in our project — they would have been part of the same Git repository. The submodule, however, makes sure that the library files don&#8217;t &#8220;leak&#8221; into our main project&#8217;s repository.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see what else has happened: a new <code>.gitmodules</code> file has been created in the root folder of our main project. Here&#8217;s what it contains:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">[submodule \"lib/spacetime\"]\r\n  path = lib/spacetime\r\n  url = https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime.git\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This <code>.gitmodules</code> file is one of multiple places where Git keeps track of the submodules in our project. Another one is <code>.git/config</code>, which now ends like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">[submodule \"lib/spacetime\"]\r\n  url = https://github.com/spencermountain/spacetime.git\r\n  active = true\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>And finally, Git also keeps a copy of each submodule&#8217;s <code>.git</code> repository in an internal <code>.git/modules</code> folder.</p>\n<p>All of these are technical details you don&#8217;t have to remember. However, it probably helps you to understand that the internal maintenance of Git submodules is quite complex. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to take one thing away: <strong>don&#8217;t mess with Git submodule configuration by hand!</strong> If you want to move, delete, or otherwise manipulate a submodule, please do yourself a favor and do <em>not</em> try this manually. Either use the proper Git commands or a <a href=\"https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sitepoint&#038;utm_medium=guestpost&#038;utm_campaign=git-submodules\">desktop GUI for Git like &#8220;Tower&#8221;</a>, which takes care of these details for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631605294submodules-in-tower@2x.png\" alt=\"Git desktop GUIs like Tower make handling Git submodules easier\" /></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at the status of our main project, now that we&#8217;ve added the submodule:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ git status\r\nOn branch master\r\nChanges to be committed:\r\n  (use \"git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\r\n  new file:   .gitmodules\r\n  new file:   lib/spacetime\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, Git regards adding a submodule as a change like any other. Accordingly, we have to commit this change like any other:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ git commit -m \"Add timezone converter library as a submodule\"\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/git-submodules-introduction/?utm_source=rss\">Understanding and Working with Submodules in Git</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

            "React class-based components are messy, confusing, hard for humans and machines. But before React 16.8, class-based components were mandatory for any projects that require states, life-cycle methods, and many other important functionalities. All these changed with the introduction of hooks in React 16.8. Hooks are game-changers. They have simplified React, made it neater, easier to write and debug, and also reduced the learning curve."

They were introduced at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM\">React Conf 2018</a> to address three major problems of class components: wrapper hell, huge components, and confusing classes. Hooks give power to React functional components, making it possible to develop an entire application with it.</p>\n\n<p>The aforementioned problems of class components are connected and solving one without the other could introduce further problems. Thankfully, hooks solved all the problems simply and efficiently while creating room for more interesting features in React. Hooks do not replace already existing React concepts and classes, they merely provide an API to access them directly.</p>\n\n<p>The React team introduced several hooks in React 16.8. However, you could also use hooks from third-party providers in your application or even create a custom hook. In this tutorial, we’ll take a look at some useful hooks in React and how to use them. We’ll go through several code examples of each hook and also explore how you’d create a custom hook.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>This tutorial requires a basic understanding of Javascript (ES6+) and React.</em></p>\n\n<div data-audience=\"non-subscriber\" data-remove=\"true\" class=\"feature-panel-container\"><span class=\"feature-panel__desc\">More after jump!

Let’s take a look at each of these in more detail.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapper-hell\">Wrapper Hell</h3>\n\n<p>Complex applications built with class components easily run into wrapper hell. If you examine the application in the React Dev Tools, you will notice deeply nested components. This makes it very difficult to work with the components or debug them. While these problems could be solved with <strong>higher-order components</strong> and <strong>render props</strong>, they require you to modify your code a bit. This could lead to confusion in a complex application.</p>\n\n<p>Hooks are easy to share, you don’t have to modify your components before reusing the logic.</p>\n\n<p>A good example of this is the use of the Redux <code>connect</code> Higher Order Component (HOC) to subscribe to the Redux store. Like all HOCs, to use the connect HOC, you have to export the component alongside the defined higher-order functions. In the case of <code>connect</code>, we’ll have something of this form.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where <code>mapStateToProps</code> and <code>mapDispatchToProps</code> are functions to be defined.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas in the Hooks era, one can easily achieve the same result neatly and succinctly by using the Redux <code>useSelector</code> and <code>useDispatch</code> hooks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"huge-components\">Huge Components</h3>\n\n<p>Class components usually contain side effects and stateful logic. As the application grows in complexity, it is common for the component to become messy and confusing. This is because the side effects are expected to be organized by <strong>lifecycle methods</strong> rather than functionality. While it is possible to split the components and make them simpler, this often introduces a higher level of abstraction.</p>\n\n<p>Hooks organize side effects by functionality and it is possible to split a component into pieces based on the functionality.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"confusing-classes\">Confusing Classes</h3>\n\n<p>Classes are generally a more difficult concept than functions. React class-based components are verbose and a bit difficult for beginners. If you are new to Javascript, you could find functions easier to get started with because of their lightweight syntax as compared to classes. The syntax could be confusing; sometimes, it is possible to forget binding an event handler which could break the code.</p>\n\n<p>React solves this problem with functional components and hooks, allowing developers to focus on the project rather than code syntax.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, the following two React components will yield exactly the same result.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      num: 0\n    };\n    this.incrementNumber = this.incrementNumber.bind(this);\n  }\n  incrementNumber() {\n    this.setState({ num: this.state.num + 1 });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;{this.state.num}&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;button onClick={this.incrementNumber}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n   \n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React, { useState } from \"react\";\nexport default function App() {\n  const [num, setNum] = useState(0);\n  function incrementNumber() {\n    setNum(num + 1);\n  }\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;{num}&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={incrementNumber}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first example is a class-based component while the second is a functional component. Although this is a simple example, notice how bogus the first example is compared to the second.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-hooks-convention-and-rules\">The Hooks Convention And Rules</h2>\n\n<p>Before delving into the various hooks, it could be helpful to take a look at the convention and rules that apply to them. Here are some of the rules that apply to hooks.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The naming convention of hooks should start with the prefix <code>use</code>. So, we can have <code>useState</code>, <code>useEffect</code>, etc. If you are using modern code editors like Atom and VSCode, the ESLint plugin could be a very useful feature for React hooks. The plugin provides useful warnings and hints on the best practices.</li>\n<li>Hooks must be called at the top level of a component, before the return statement. They can&rsquo;t be called inside a conditional statement, loop, or nested functions.</li>\n<li>Hooks must be called from a React function (inside a React component or another hook). It shouldn’t be called from a Vanilla JS function.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-usestate-hook\">The <code>useState</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>useState</code> hook is the most basic and useful React hook. Like other built-in hooks, this hook must be imported from <code>react</code> to be used in our application.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useState} from 'react'</code></pre>\n\n<p>To initialize the state, we must declare both the state and its updater function and pass an initial value.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const [state, updaterFn] = useState('')</code></pre>\n\n<p>We are free to call our state and updater function whatever we want but by convention, the first element of the array will be our state while the second element will be the updater function. It is a common practice to prefix our updater function with the prefix <strong>set</strong> followed by the name of our state in camel case form.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, let’s set a state to hold count values.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const [count, setCount] = useState(0)</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice that the initial value of our <code>count</code> state is set to <code>0</code> and not an empty string. In other words, we can initialize our state to any kind of JavaScript variables, namely number, string, boolean, array, object, and even BigInt. There is a clear difference between setting states with the <code>useState</code> hook and class-based component states. It is noteworthy that the <code>useState</code> hook returns an array, also known as state variables and in the example above, we destructured the array into <code>state</code> and the <code>updater</code> function.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rerendering-components\">Rerendering Components</h3>\n\n<p>Setting states with the <code>useState</code> hook causes the corresponding component to rerender. However, this only happens if React detects a difference between the previous or old state and the new state. React does the state comparison using the Javascript <code>Object.is</code> <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is#description\">algorithm</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"setting-states-with-usestate\">Setting States With <code>useState</code></h3>\n\n<p>Our <code>count</code> state can be set to new state values by simply passing the new value to the <code>setCount</code> updater function as follows <code>setCount(newValue)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This method works when we don&rsquo;t want to reference the previous state value. If we wish to do that, we need to pass a function to the <code>setCount</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming we want to add 5 to our <code>count</code> variable anytime a button is clicked, we could do the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useState} from 'react'\n\nconst CountExample = () =&gt; {\n  // initialize our count state\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  \n  // add 5 to to the count previous state\n  const handleClick = () =&gt;{\n    setCount(prevCount =&gt; prevCount + 5)\n  } \n  return(\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;{count} &lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Add Five&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\n\nexport default CountExample</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the code above, we first imported the <code>useState</code> hook from <code>react</code> and then initialized the <code>count</code> state with a default value of 0. We created an <code>onClick</code> handler to increment the value of <code>count</code> by 5 whenever the button is clicked. Then we displayed the result in an <code>h1</code> tag.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"setting-arrays-and-object-states\">Setting Arrays And Object States</h3>\n\n<p>States for arrays and objects can be set in much the same way as other data types. However, if we wish to retain already existing values, we need to use the ES6 spread operator when setting states.</p>\n\n<p>The spread operator in Javascript is used to create a new object from an already existing object. This is useful here because <code>React</code> compares the states with the <code>Object.is</code> operation and then rerender accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s consider the code below for setting states on button click.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useState} from 'react'\n\nconst StateExample = () =&gt; {\n  //initialize our array and object states\n  const [arr, setArr] = useState([2, 4])\n  const [obj, setObj] = useState({num: 1, name: 'Desmond'})\n  \n  // set arr to the new array values\n  const handleArrClick = () =&gt;{\n    const newArr = [1, 5, 7]\n    setArr([...arr, ...newArr])\n  } \n  \n  // set obj to the new object values\n  const handleObjClick = () =&gt;{\n    const newObj = {name: 'Ifeanyi', age: 25}\n    setObj({...obj, ...newObj})\n  } \n\n  return(\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick ={handleArrClick}&gt;Set Array State&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick ={handleObjClick}&gt;Set Object State&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\n\nexport default StateExample</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, we created two states <code>arr</code> and <code>obj</code>, and initialized them to some array and object values respectively. We then created <code>onClick</code> handlers called <code>handleArrClick</code> and <code>handleObjClick</code> to set the states of the array and object respectively. When <code>handleArrClick</code> fires, we call <code>setArr</code> and use the ES6 spread operator to spread already existing array values and add <code>newArr</code> to it.</p>\n\n<p>We did the same thing for <code>handleObjClick</code> handler. Here we called <code>setObj</code>, spread the existing object values using the ES6 spread operator, and updated the values of <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"async-nature-of-usestate\">Async Nature Of <code>useState</code></h3>\n\n<p>As we have already seen, we set states with <code>useState</code> by passing a new value to the updater function. If the updater is called multiple times, the new values will be added to a queue and re-rendering is done accordingly using the JavaScript <code>Object.is</code> comparison.</p>\n\n<p>The states are updated asynchronously. This means that the new state is first added to a pending state and thereafter, the state is updated. So, you may still get the old state value if you access the state immediately it is set.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s consider the following example to observe this behavior.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/vibrant-bogdan-49hl4?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\"\n     style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n     title=\"vibrant-bogdan-49hl4\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n\n<p>In the code above, we created a <code>count</code> state using the <code>useState</code> hook. We then created an <code>onClick</code> handler to increment the <code>count</code> state whenever the button is clicked.\nObserve that although the <code>count</code> state increased, as displayed in the <code>h2</code> tag, the previous state is still logged in the console. This is due to the async nature of the hook.</p>\n\n<p>If we wish to get the new state, we can handle it in a similar way we would handle async functions. Here is one way to do that.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/dazzling-haze-ukzrs?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\"\n     style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n     title=\"dazzling-haze-ukzrs\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n\n<p>Here, we stored created <code>newCountValue</code> to store the updated count value and then set the <code>count</code> state with the updated value. Then, we logged the updated count value in the console.</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-useeffect-hook\">The <code>useEffect</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p><code>useEffect</code> is another important React hook used in most projects. It does a similar thing to the class-based component’s <code>componentDidMount</code>, <code>componentWillUnmount</code>, and <code>componentDidUpdate</code> lifecycle methods. <code>useEffect</code> provides us an opportunity to write imperative codes that may have side effects on the application. Examples of such effects include logging, subscriptions, mutations, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The user can decide when the <code>useEffect</code> will run, however, if it is not set, the side effects will run on every rendering or rerendering.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the example below.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useState, useEffect} from 'react'\n\nconst App = () =&gt;{\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  useEffect(() =&gt;{\n    console.log(count)\n  })\n\n  return(\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the code above, we simply logged <code>count</code> in the <code>useEffect</code>. This will run after every render of the component.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, we may want to run the hook once (on the mount) in our component. We can achieve this by providing a second parameter to <code>useEffect</code> hook.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useState, useEffect} from 'react'\n\nconst App = () =&gt;{\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  useEffect(() =&gt;{\n    setCount(count + 1)\n  }, [])\n\n  return(\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;{count}&lt;/h1&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>useEffect</code> hook has two parameters, the first parameter is the function we want to run while the second parameter is an array of dependencies. If the second parameter is not provided, the hook will run continuously.</p>\n\n<p>By passing an empty square bracket to the hook’s second parameter, we instruct React to run the <code>useEffect</code> hook only once, on the mount. This will display the value <code>1</code> in the <code>h1</code> tag because the count will be updated once, from 0 to 1, when the component mounts.</p>\n\n<p>We could also make our side effect run whenever some dependent values change. This can be done by passing these values in the list of dependencies.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, we could make the <code>useEffect</code> to run whenever <code>count</code> changes as follows.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nconst App = () =&gt; {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    console.log(count);\n  }, [count]);\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n};\nexport default App;</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>useEffect</code> above will run when either of these two conditions is met.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On mount &mdash; after the component is rendered.</li>\n<li>When the value of <code>count</code> changes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>On mount, the <code>console.log</code> expression will run and log <code>count</code> to 0. Once the <code>count</code> is updated, the second condition is met, so the <code>useEffect</code> runs again, this will continue whenever the button is clicked.</p>\n\n<p>Once we provide the second argument to <code>useEffect</code>, it is expected that we pass all the dependencies to it. If you have <code>ESLINT</code> installed, it will show a lint error if any dependency is not passed to the parameter list. This could also make the side effect behave unexpectedly, especially if it depends on the parameters that are not passed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cleaning-up-the-effect\">Cleaning Up The Effect</h3>\n\n<p><code>useEffect</code> also allows us to clean up resources before the component unmounts. This may be necessary to prevent memory leaks and make the application more efficient. To do this, we’d return the clean-up function at the end of the hook.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">useEffect(() =&gt; {\n  console.log('mounted')\n\n  return () =&gt; console.log('unmounting... clean up here')\n})</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>useEffect</code> hook above will log <code>mounted</code> when the component is mounted. <em>Unmounting… clean up here</em> will be logged when the component unmounts. This can happen when the component is removed from the UI.</p>\n\n<p>The clean-up process typically follows the form below.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">useEffect(() =&gt; {\n  //The effect we intend to make\n  effect\n  \n  //We then return the clean up\n  return () =&gt; the cleanup/unsubscription\n})</code></pre>\n\n<p>While you may not find so many use cases for <code>useEffect</code> subscriptions, it is useful when dealing with subscriptions and timers. Particularly, when dealing with web sockets, you may need to unsubscribe from the network to save resources and improve performance when the component unmounts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fetching-and-refetching-data-with-useeffect\">Fetching And Refetching Data With <code>useEffect</code></h3>\n\n<p>One of the commonest use cases of the <code>useEffect</code> hook is fetching and prefetching data from an API.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate this, we’ll use fake user data I created from <code>JSONPlaceholder</code> to fetch data with the <code>useEffect</code> hook.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);\n  const endPoint =\n    \"https://my-json-server.typicode.com/ifeanyidike/jsondata/users\";\n\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const fetchUsers = async () =&gt; {\n      const { data } = await axios.get(endPoint);\n      setUsers(data);\n    };\n    fetchUsers();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"App\"&gt;\n      {users.map((user) =&gt; (\n            &lt;div&gt;\n              &lt;h2&gt;{user.name}&lt;/h2&gt;\n              &lt;p&gt;Occupation: {user.job}&lt;/p&gt;\n              &lt;p&gt;Sex: {user.sex}&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          ))}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the code above, we created a <code>users</code> state using the <code>useState</code> hook. Then we fetched data from an API using Axios. This is an asynchronous process, and so we used the async/await function, we could have also used the dot then the syntax. Since we fetched a list of users, we simply mapped through it to display the data.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that we passed an empty parameter to the hook. This ensures that it is called just once when the component mounts.</p>\n\n<p>We can also <strong>refetch</strong> the data when some conditions change. We’ll show this in the code below.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [userIDs, setUserIDs] = useState([]);\n  const [user, setUser] = useState({});\n  const [currentID, setCurrentID] = useState(1);\n\n  const endPoint =\n    \"https://my-json-server.typicode.com/ifeanyidike/userdata/users\";\n\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    axios.get(endPoint).then(({ data }) =&gt; setUserIDs(data));\n  }, []);\n\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const fetchUserIDs = async () =&gt; {\n      const { data } = await axios.get(`${endPoint}/${currentID}`});\n      setUser(data);\n    };\n\n    fetchUserIDs();\n  }, [currentID]);\n\n  const moveToNextUser = () =&gt; {\n    setCurrentID((prevId) =&gt; (prevId &lt; userIDs.length ? prevId + 1 : prevId));\n  };\n  const moveToPrevUser = () =&gt; {\n    setCurrentID((prevId) =&gt; (prevId === 1 ? prevId : prevId - 1));\n  };\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"App\"&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;h2&gt;{user.name}&lt;/h2&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;Occupation: {user.job}&lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;p&gt;Sex: {user.sex}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n  \n      &lt;button onClick={moveToPrevUser}&gt;Prev&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={moveToNextUser}&gt;Next&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we created two <code>useEffect</code> hooks. In the first one, we used the dot then syntax to get all users from our API. This is necessary to determine the number of users.</p>\n\n<p>We then created another <code>useEffect</code> hook to get a user based on the <code>id</code>. This <code>useEffect</code> will refetch the data whenever the id changes. To ensure this, we passed the <code>id</code> in the dependency list.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we created functions to update the value of our <code>id</code> whenever the buttons are clicked. Once the value of the <code>id</code> changes, the <code>useEffect</code> will run again and refetch the data.</p>\n\n<p>If we want, we can even clean up or cancel the promise-based token in Axios, we could do that with the clean-up method discussed above.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const source = axios.CancelToken.source();\n    const fetchUsers = async () =&gt; {\n      const { data } = await axios.get(`${endPoint}/${num}`, {\n        cancelToken: source.token\n      });\n      setUser(data);\n    };\n    fetchUsers();\n\n    return () =&gt; source.cancel();\n  }, [num]);</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we passed the Axios’ token as a second parameter to <code>axios.get</code>. When the component unmounts we then canceled the subscription by calling the cancel method of the source object.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-usereducer-hook\">The <code>useReducer</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>useReducer</code> hook is a very useful React hook that does a similar thing to the <code>useState</code> hook. According to the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer\">React documentation</a>, this hook should be used to handle more complex logic than the <code>useState</code> hook. It’s worthy of note that the <code>useState</code> hook is internally implemented with the useReducer hook.</p>\n\n<p>The hook takes a reducer as an argument and can optionally take the initial state and an init function as arguments.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState, init)</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, <code>init</code> is a function and it is used whenever we want to create the initial state lazily.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s look at how to implement the <code>useReducer</code> hook by creating a simple to-do app as shown in the sandbox below.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"video-embed-container break-out\">\n  <div class=\"video-embed-container--wrapper\"\n\t\n  >\n\t\t<lite-vimeo\n\t\t\tvideoid=\"617035545\"\n\t\t\tvideotitle=\"Todo Example\"\n\t\t></lite-vimeo>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Todo Example</figcaption>\n\t\n</figure>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/naughty-bhaskara-iq9y5?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\"\n     style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n     title=\"naughty-bhaskara-iq9y5\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n\n<p>First off, we should create our reducer to hold the states.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export const ADD_TODO = \"ADD_TODO\";\nexport const REMOVE_TODO = \"REMOVE_TODO\";\nexport const COMPLETE_TODO = \"COMPLETE_TODO\";\n\nconst reducer = (state, action) =&gt; {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD_TODO:\n      const newTodo = {\n        id: action.id,\n        text: action.text,\n        completed: false\n      };\n      return [...state, newTodo];\n    case REMOVE_TODO:\n      return state.filter((todo) =&gt; todo.id !== action.id);\n    case COMPLETE_TODO:\n      const completeTodo = state.map((todo) =&gt; {\n        if (todo.id === action.id) {\n          return {\n            ...todo,\n            completed: !todo.completed\n          };\n        } else {\n          return todo;\n        }\n      });\n      return completeTodo;\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\nexport default reducer;</code></pre>\n\n<p>We created three constants corresponding to our action types. We could have used strings directly but this method is preferable to avoid typos.</p>\n\n<p>Then we created our reducer function. Like in <code>Redux</code>, the reducer must take the state and the action object. But unlike Redux, we don&rsquo;t need to initialize our reducer here.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, for a lot of state management use-cases, a <code>useReducer</code> along with the <code>dispatch</code> exposed via context can enable a larger application to fire actions, update <code>state</code> and listen to it.</p>\n\n<p>Then we used the <code>switch</code> statements to check the action type passed by the user. If the action type is <code>ADD_TODO</code>, we want to pass a new to-do and if it is <code>REMOVE_TODO</code>, we want to filter the to-dos and remove the one that corresponds to the <code>id</code> passed by the user. If it is <code>COMPLETE_TODO</code>, we want to map through the to-dos and toggle the one with the <code>id</code> passed by the user.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the <code>App.js</code> file where we implemented the <code>reducer</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useReducer, useState } from \"react\";\nimport \"./styles.css\";\nimport reducer, { ADD_TODO, REMOVE_TODO, COMPLETE_TODO } from \"./reducer\";\nexport default function App() {\n  const [id, setId] = useState(0);\n  const [text, setText] = useState(\"\");\n  const initialState = [\n    {\n      id: id,\n      text: \"First Item\",\n      completed: false\n    }\n  ];\n\n  //We could also pass an empty array as the initial state\n  //const initialState = []\n  \n  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);\n  const addTodoItem = (e) =&gt; {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    const newId = id + 1;\n    setId(newId);\n    dispatch({\n      type: ADD_TODO,\n      id: newId,\n      text: text\n    });\n    setText(\"\");\n  };\n  const removeTodo = (id) =&gt; {\n    dispatch({ type: REMOVE_TODO, id });\n  };\n  const completeTodo = (id) =&gt; {\n    dispatch({ type: COMPLETE_TODO, id });\n  };\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"App\"&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;Todo Example&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;form className=\"input\" onSubmit={addTodoItem}&gt;\n        &lt;input value={text} onChange={(e) =&gt; setText(e.target.value)} /&gt;\n        &lt;button disabled={text.length === 0} type=\"submit\"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;/form&gt;\n      &lt;div className=\"todos\"&gt;\n        {state.map((todo) =&gt; (\n          &lt;div key={todo.id} className=\"todoItem\"&gt;\n            &lt;p className={todo.completed && \"strikethrough\"}&gt;{todo.text}&lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;span onClick={() =&gt; removeTodo(todo.id)}&gt;&#10005;&lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;span onClick={() =&gt; completeTodo(todo.id)}&gt;&#10003;&lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        ))}\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we created a form containing an input element, to collect the user’s input, and a button to trigger the action. When the form is submitted, we dispatched an action of type <code>ADD_TODO</code>, passing a new id and to-do text. We created a new id by incrementing the previous id value by 1. We then cleared the input text box. To delete and complete to-do, we simply dispatched the appropriate actions. These have already been implemented in the reducer as shown above.</p>\n\n<p>However, the magic happens because we are using the <code>useReducer</code> hook. This hook accepts the reducer and the initial state and returns the state and the dispatch function. Here, the dispatch function serves the same purpose as the setter function for the <code>useState</code> hook and we can call it anything we want instead of <code>dispatch</code>.</p>\n\n<p>To display the to-do items, we simply mapped through the list of to-dos returned in our state object as shown in the code above.</p>\n\n<p>This shows the power of the <code>useReducer</code> hook. We could also achieve this functionality with the <code>useState</code> hook but as you can see from the example above, the <code>useReducer</code> hook helped us to keep things neater. <code>useReducer</code> is often beneficial when the state object is a complex structure and is updated in different ways as against a simple value-replace. Also, once these update functions get more complicated, <code>useReducer</code> makes it easy to hold all that complexity in a reducer function (which is a pure JS function) making it very easy to write tests for the reducer function alone.</p>\n\n<p>We could have also passed the third argument to the <code>useReducer</code> hook to create the initial state lazily. This means that we could calculate the initial state in an <code>init</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, we could create an <code>init</code> function as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const initFunc = () =&gt; [\n  {\n      id: id,\n      text: \"First Item\",\n      completed: false\n    }\n]</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then pass it to our <code>useReducer</code> hook.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState, initFunc)</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we do this, the <code>initFunc</code> will override the <code>initialState</code> we provided and the initial state will be calculated lazily.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-usecontext-hook\">The <code>useContext</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p>The React Context API provides a way to share states or data throughout the React component tree. The API has been available in React, as an experimental feature, for a while but it became safe to use in React 16.3.0. The API makes data sharing between components easy while eliminating prop drilling.</p>\n\n<p>While you can apply the React Context to your entire application, it is also possible to apply it to part of the application.</p>\n\n<p>To use the hook, you need to first create a context using <code>React.createContext</code> and this context can then be passed to the hook.</p>\n\n<p>To demonstrate the use of the <code>useContext</code> hook, let’s create a simple app that will increase font size throughout our application.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s create our context in <code>context.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { createContext } from \"react\";\n\n//Here, we set the initial fontSize as 16.\nconst fontSizeContext = createContext(16);\nexport default fontSizeContext;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we created a context and passed an initial value of <code>16</code> to it, and then exported the context. Next, let’s connect our context to our application.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import FontSizeContext from \"./context\";\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\nimport PageOne from \"./PageOne\";\nimport PageTwo from \"./PageTwo\";\nconst App = () =&gt; {\n  const [size, setSize] = useState(16);\n  return (\n    &lt;FontSizeContext.Provider value={size}&gt;\n      &lt;PageOne /&gt;\n      &lt;PageTwo /&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setSize(size + 5)}&gt;Increase font&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;button\n        onClick={() =&gt;\n          setSize((prevSize) =&gt; Math.min(11, prevSize - 5))\n        }\n      &gt;\n        Decrease font\n      &lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/FontSizeContext.Provider&gt;\n  );\n};\nexport default App;</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, we wrapped our entire component tree with <code>FontSizeContext.Provider</code> and passed <code>size</code> to its value prop. Here, <code>size</code> is a state-created with the <code>useState</code> hook. This allows us to change the value prop whenever the <code>size</code> state changes. By wrapping the entire component with the <code>Provider</code>, we can access the context anywhere in our application.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, we accessed the context in <code>&lt;PageOne /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;PageTwo /&gt;</code>. As a result of this, the font size will increase across these two components when we increase it from the <code>App.js</code> file. We can increase or decrease the font size from the buttons as shown above and once we do, the font size changes throughout the application.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useContext } from \"react\";\nimport context from \"./context\";\nconst PageOne = () =&gt; {\n  const size = useContext(context);\n  return &lt;p style={{ fontSize: `${size}px` }}&gt;Content from the first page&lt;/p&gt;;\n};\nexport default PageOne;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we accessed the context using the <code>useContext</code> hook from our <code>PageOne</code> component. We then used this context to set our font-size property. A similar procedure applies to the <code>PageTwo.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<p>Themes or other higher-order app-level configurations are good candidates for contexts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-usecontext-and-usereducer\">Using <code>useContext</code> And <code>useReducer</code></h3>\n\n<p>When used with the <code>useReducer</code> hook, <code>useContext</code> allows us to create our own state management system. We can create global states and easily manage them in our application.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s improve our to-do application using the context API.</p>\n\n<p>As usual, we need to create a <code>todoContext</code> in the <code>todoContext.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { createContext } from \"react\";\nconst initialState = [];\nexport default createContext(initialState);</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we created the context, passing an initial value of an empty array. Then we exported the context.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s refactor our <code>App.js</code> file by separating the to-do list and items.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useReducer, useState } from \"react\";\nimport \"./styles.css\";\nimport todoReducer, { ADD_TODO } from \"./todoReducer\";\nimport TodoContext from \"./todoContext\";\nimport TodoList from \"./TodoList\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [id, setId] = useState(0);\n  const [text, setText] = useState(\"\");\n  const initialState = [];\n  const [todoState, todoDispatch] = useReducer(todoReducer, initialState);\n\n  const addTodoItem = (e) =&gt; {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    const newId = id + 1;\n    setId(newId);\n    todoDispatch({\n      type: ADD_TODO,\n      id: newId,\n      text: text\n    });\n    setText(\"\");\n  };\n  return (\n    &lt;TodoContext.Provider value={[todoState, todoDispatch]}&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"app\"&gt;\n          &lt;h1&gt;Todo Example&lt;/h1&gt;\n          &lt;form className=\"input\" onSubmit={addTodoItem}&gt;\n            &lt;input value={text} onChange={(e) =&gt; setText(e.target.value)} /&gt;\n            &lt;button disabled={text.length === 0} type=\"submit\"&gt;\n              +\n            &lt;/button&gt;\n          &lt;/form&gt;\n          &lt;TodoList /&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/TodoContext.Provider&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we wrapped our <code>App.js</code> file with the <code>TodoContext.Provider</code> then we passed the return values of our <code>todoReducer</code> to it. This makes the reducer’s state and <code>dispatch</code> function to be accessible throughout our application.</p>\n\n<p>We then separated the to-do display into a component <code>TodoList</code>. We did this without prop drilling, thanks to the Context API. Let’s take a look at the <code>TodoList.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React, { useContext } from \"react\";\nimport TodoContext from \"./todoContext\";\nimport Todo from \"./Todo\";\nconst TodoList = () =&gt; {\n  const [state] = useContext(TodoContext);\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"todos\"&gt;\n      {state.map((todo) =&gt; (\n        &lt;Todo key={todo.id} todo={todo} /&gt;\n      ))}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n};\nexport default TodoList;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using array destructuring, we can access the state (leaving the dispatch function) from the context using the <code>useContext</code> hook. We can then map through the state and display the to-do items. We still extracted this in a <code>Todo</code> component. The ES6+ map function requires us to pass a unique key and since we need the specific to-do, we pass it alongside as well.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at the <code>Todo</code> component.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React, { useContext } from \"react\";\nimport TodoContext from \"./todoContext\";\nimport { REMOVE_TODO, COMPLETE_TODO } from \"./todoReducer\";\nconst Todo = ({ todo }) =&gt; {\n  const [, dispatch] = useContext(TodoContext);\n  const removeTodo = (id) =&gt; {\n    dispatch({ type: REMOVE_TODO, id });\n  };\n  const completeTodo = (id) =&gt; {\n    dispatch({ type: COMPLETE_TODO, id });\n  };\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"todoItem\"&gt;\n      &lt;p className={todo.completed ? \"strikethrough\" : \"nostrikes\"}&gt;\n        {todo.text}\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;span onClick={() =&gt; removeTodo(todo.id)}&gt;&#10005;&lt;/span&gt;\n      &lt;span onClick={() =&gt; completeTodo(todo.id)}&gt;&#10003;&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n};\nexport default Todo;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again using array destructuring, we accessed the dispatch function from the context. This allows us to define the <code>completeTodo</code> and <code>removeTodo</code> function as already discussed in the <code>useReducer</code> section. With the <code>todo</code> prop passed from <code>todoList.js</code> we can display a to-do item. We can also mark it as completed and remove the to-do as we deem fit.</p>\n\n<p>It is also possible to nest more than one context provider in the root of our application. This means that we can use more than one context to perform different functions in an application.</p>\n\n<p>To demonstrate this, let’s add theming to the to-do example.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what we’ll be building.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"video-embed-container break-out\">\n  <div class=\"video-embed-container--wrapper\"\n\t\n  >\n\t\t<lite-vimeo\n\t\t\tvideoid=\"617978634\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t></lite-vimeo>\n\t</div>\n\t\n</figure>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/cold-glitter-3ipz4?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\"\n     style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n     title=\"cold-glitter-3ipz4\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n\n<p>Again, we have to create <code>themeContext</code>. To do this, create a <code>themeContext.js</code> file and add the following codes.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { createContext } from \"react\";\nimport colors from \"./colors\";\nexport default createContext(colors.light);</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we created a context and passed <code>colors.light</code> as the initial value. Let’s define the colors with this property in the <code>colors.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const colors = {\n  light: {\n    backgroundColor: \"#fff\",\n    color: \"#000\"\n  },\n  dark: {\n    backgroundColor: \"#000\",\n    color: \"#fff\"\n  }\n};\nexport default colors;</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the code above, we created a <code>colors</code> object containing light and dark properties. Each property has <code>backgroundColor</code> and <code>color</code> object.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we create the <code>themeReducer</code> to handle the theme states.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import Colors from \"./colors\";\nexport const LIGHT = \"LIGHT\";\nexport const DARK = \"DARK\";\nconst themeReducer = (state, action) =&gt; {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case LIGHT:\n      return {\n        ...Colors.light\n      };\n    case DARK:\n      return {\n        ...Colors.dark\n      };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\nexport default themeReducer;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Like all reducers, the <code>themeReducer</code> takes the state and the action. It then uses the <code>switch</code> statement to determine the current action. If it’s of type <code>LIGHT</code>, we simply assign <code>Colors.light</code> props and if it’s of type <code>DARK</code>, we display <code>Colors.dark</code> props. We could have easily done this with the <code>useState</code> hook but we choose <code>useReducer</code> to drive the point home.</p>\n\n<p>Having set up the <code>themeReducer</code>, we can then integrate it in our <code>App.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useReducer, useState, useCallback } from \"react\";\nimport \"./styles.css\";\nimport todoReducer, { ADD_TODO } from \"./todoReducer\";\nimport TodoContext from \"./todoContext\";\nimport ThemeContext from \"./themeContext\";\nimport TodoList from \"./TodoList\";\nimport themeReducer, { DARK, LIGHT } from \"./themeReducer\";\nimport Colors from \"./colors\";\nimport ThemeToggler from \"./ThemeToggler\";\n\nconst themeSetter = useCallback(\n      theme =&gt; themeDispatch({type: theme}, \n    [themeDispatch]);\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [id, setId] = useState(0);\n  const [text, setText] = useState(\"\");\n  const initialState = [];\n  const [todoState, todoDispatch] = useReducer(todoReducer, initialState);\n  const [themeState, themeDispatch] = useReducer(themeReducer, Colors.light);\n  const themeSetter = useCallback(\n    (theme) =&gt; {\n      themeDispatch({ type: theme });\n    },\n    [themeDispatch]\n  );\n  const addTodoItem = (e) =&gt; {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    const newId = id + 1;\n    setId(newId);\n    todoDispatch({\n      type: ADD_TODO,\n      id: newId,\n      text: text\n    });\n    setText(\"\");\n  };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;TodoContext.Provider value={[todoState, todoDispatch]}&gt;\n      &lt;ThemeContext.Provider\n        value={[\n          themeState,\n          themeSetter\n        ]}\n      &gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"app\" style={{ ...themeState }}&gt;\n          &lt;ThemeToggler /&gt;\n          &lt;h1&gt;Todo Example&lt;/h1&gt;\n          &lt;form className=\"input\" onSubmit={addTodoItem}&gt;\n            &lt;input value={text} onChange={(e) =&gt; setText(e.target.value)} /&gt;\n            &lt;button disabled={text.length === 0} type=\"submit\"&gt;\n              +\n            &lt;/button&gt;\n          &lt;/form&gt;\n          &lt;TodoList /&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/ThemeContext.Provider&gt;\n    &lt;/TodoContext.Provider&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, we added a few things to our already existing to-do application. We began by importing the <code>ThemeContext</code>, <code>themeReducer</code>, <code>ThemeToggler</code>, and <code>Colors</code>. We created a reducer using the <code>useReducer</code> hook, passing the <code>themeReducer</code> and an initial value of <code>Colors.light</code> to it. This returned the <code>themeState</code> and <code>themeDispatch</code> to us.</p>\n\n<p>We then nested our component with the provider function from the <code>ThemeContext</code>, passing the <code>themeState</code> and the <code>dispatch</code> functions to it. We also added theme styles to it by spreading out the <code>themeStates</code>. This works because the <code>colors</code> object already defined properties similar to what the JSX styles will accept.</p>\n\n<p>However, the actual theme toggling happens in the <code>ThemeToggler</code> component. Let’s take a look at it.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import ThemeContext from \"./themeContext\";\nimport { useContext, useState } from \"react\";\nimport { DARK, LIGHT } from \"./themeReducer\";\nconst ThemeToggler = () =&gt; {\n  const [showLight, setShowLight] = useState(true);\n  const [themeState, themeSetter] = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const dispatchDarkTheme = () =&gt; themeSetter(DARK);\n  const dispatchLightTheme = () =&gt; themeSetter(LIGHT);\n  const toggleTheme = () =&gt; {\n    showLight ? dispatchDarkTheme() : dispatchLightTheme();\n    setShowLight(!showLight);\n  };\n  console.log(themeState);\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={toggleTheme}&gt;\n        {showLight ? \"Change to Dark Theme\" : \"Change to Light Theme\"}\n      &lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n};\nexport default ThemeToggler;</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this component, we used the <code>useContext</code> hook to retrieve the values we passed to the <code>ThemeContext.Provider</code> from our <code>App.js</code> file. As shown above, these values include the <code>ThemeState</code>, dispatch function for the light theme, and dispatch function for the dark theme. Thereafter, we simply called the dispatch functions to toggle the themes. We also created a state <code>showLight</code> to determine the current theme. This allows us to easily change the button text depending on the current theme.</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-usememo-hook\">The <code>useMemo</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>useMemo</code> hook is designed to memoize expensive computations. Memoization simply means caching. It caches the computation result with respect to the dependency values so that when the same values are passed, <code>useMemo</code> will just spit out the already computed value without recomputing it again. This can significantly improve performance when done correctly.</p>\n\n<p>The hook can be used as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const memoizedResult = useMemo(() => expensiveComputation(a, b), [a, b])</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let’s consider three cases of the <code>useMemo</code> hook.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>When the dependency values, a and b remain the same.</strong><br />\nThe <code>useMemo</code> hook will return the already computed memoized value without recomputation.</li>\n<li><strong>When the dependency values, a and b change.</strong><br />\nThe hook will recompute the value.</li>\n<li><strong>When no dependency value is passed.</strong><br />\nThe hook will recompute the value.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at an example to demonstrate this concept.</p>\n\n<p>In the example below, we’ll be computing the <strong>PAYE</strong> and <strong>Income after PAYE</strong> of a company’s employees with fake data from JSONPlaceholder.</p>\n\n<p>The calculation will be based on the personal income tax calculation procedure for Nigeria providers by PricewaterhouseCoopers available <a href=\"https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/nigeria/individual/sample-personal-income-tax-calculation\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is shown in the sandbox below.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/sparkling-water-fludc?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\"\n     style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n     title=\"sparkling-water-fludc\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n\n<p>First, we queried the API to get the employees’ data. We also get data for each employee (with respect to their employee id).</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const [employee, setEmployee] = useState({});\n  const [employees, setEmployees] = useState([]);\n  const [num, setNum] = useState(1);\n  const endPoint =\n    \"https://my-json-server.typicode.com/ifeanyidike/jsondata/employees\";\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const getEmployee = async () =&gt; {\n      const { data } = await axios.get(`${endPoint}/${num}`);\n      setEmployee(data);\n    };\n    getEmployee();\n  }, [num]);\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    axios.get(endPoint).then(({ data }) =&gt; setEmployees(data));\n  }, [num]);</code></pre>\n\n<p>We used <code>axios</code> and the <code>async/await</code> method in the first <code>useEffect</code> and then the dot then syntax in the second. These two approaches work in the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Next, using the employee data we got from above, let’s calculate the relief variables:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const taxVariablesCompute = useMemo(() =&gt; {\n    const { income, noOfChildren, noOfDependentRelatives } = employee;\n    \n    //supposedly complex calculation\n    //tax relief computations for relief Allowance, children relief, \n    // relatives relief and pension relief\n\n    const reliefs =\n      reliefAllowance1 +\n      reliefAllowance2 +\n      childrenRelief +\n      relativesRelief +\n      pensionRelief;\n    return reliefs;\n  }, [employee]);</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a fairly complex calculation and so we had to wrap it in a <code>useMemo</code> hook to memoize or optimize it. Memoizing it this way will ensure that the calculation will not be recomputed if we tried to access the same employee again.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, using the tax relief values obtained above, we’d like to calculate the PAYE and income after PAYE.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const taxCalculation = useMemo(() =&gt; {\n    const { income } = employee;\n    let taxableIncome = income - taxVariablesCompute;\n    let PAYE = 0;\n    \n    //supposedly complex calculation\n    //computation to compute the PAYE based on the taxable income and tax endpoints\n    \n    const netIncome = income - PAYE;\n    return { PAYE, netIncome };\n  }, [employee, taxVariablesCompute]);</code></pre>\n\n<p>We performed tax calculation (a fairly complex calculation) using the above-computed tax variables and then memoized it with the <code>useMemo</code> hook.</p>\n\n<p>The complete code is available on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/ifeanyidike/bc008cf6a28140199aeb74d7ecd90261\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This follows the tax calculation procedure given <a href=\"https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/nigeria/individual/sample-personal-income-tax-calculation\">here</a>. We first computed the tax relief considering income, number of children, and number of dependent relatives. Then, we multiplied the taxable income by the PIT rates in steps. While the calculation in question is not entirely necessary for this tutorial, it is provided to show us why <code>useMemo</code> may be necessary. This is also a fairly complex calculation and so we may need to memorize it with <code>useMemo</code> as shown above.</p>\n\n<p>After calculating the values, we simply displayed the result.</p>\n\n<p>Note the following about the <code>useMemo</code> hook.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>useMemo</code> should be used only when it is necessary to optimize the computation. In other words, when recomputation is expensive.</li>\n<li>It is advisable to first write the calculation without memorization and only memorize it if it is causing performance issues.</li>\n<li>Unnecessary and irrelevant use of the <code>useMemo</code> hook may even compound the performance issues.</li>\n<li>Sometimes, too much memoization can also cause performance issues.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-usecallback-hook\">The <code>useCallback</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p><code>useCallback</code> serves the same purpose as <code>useMemo</code> but it returns a memoized callback instead of a memoized value. In other words, <code>useCallback</code> is the same as passing <code>useMemo</code> without a function call.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, consider the following codes below.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React, {useCallback, useMemo} from 'react'\n\nconst MemoizationExample = () =&gt; {\n  const a = 5\n  const b = 7\n  \n  const memoResult = useMemo(() =&gt; a + b, [a, b])\n  const callbackResult = useCallback(a + b, [a, b])\n\n  console.log(memoResult)\n  console.log(callbackResult)\n\n  return(\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  ) \n}\n\nexport default MemoizationExample</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above example, both <code>memoResult</code> and <code>callbackResult</code> will give the same value of <code>12</code>. Here, <code>useCallback</code> will return a memoized value. However, we could also make it return a memoized callback by passing it as a function.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>useCallback</code> below will return a memoized callback.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">...\n  const callbackResult = useCallback(() =&gt; a + b, [a, b])\n...</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can then trigger the callback when an action is performed or in a <code>useEffect</code> hook.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useCallback, useEffect} from 'react'\nconst memoizationExample = () =&gt; {\n  const a = 5\n  const b = 7\n  const callbackResult = useCallback(() =&gt; a + b, [a, b])\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const callback = callbackResult()\n    console.log(callback)   \n  })\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick= {() =&gt; console.log(callbackResult())}&gt;\n        Trigger Callback\n      &lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n} \nexport default memoizationExample</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, we defined a callback function using the <code>useCallback</code> hook. We then called the callback in a <code>useEffect</code> hook when the component mounts and also when a button is clicked.</p>\n\n<p>Both the <code>useEffect</code> and the button click yield the same result.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the concepts, do’s, and don’ts that apply to the <code>useMemo</code> hook also apply to the <code>useCallback</code> hook. We can recreate the <code>useMemo</code> example with <code>useCallback</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-useref-hook\">The <code>useRef</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p><code>useRef</code> returns an object that can persist in an application. The hook has only one property, <code>current</code>, and we can easily pass an argument to it.</p>\n\n<p>It serves the same purpose a <code>createRef</code> used in class-based components. We can create a reference with this hook as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const newRef = useRef('')</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we created a new ref called <code>newRef</code> and passed an empty string to it.</p>\n\n<p>This hook is used mainly for two purposes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Accessing or manipulating the DOM, and</li>\n<li>Storing mutable states &mdash; this is useful when we don’t want the component to rerender when a value change.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"manipulating-the-dom\">Manipulating the DOM</h3>\n\n<p>When passed to a DOM element, the ref object points to that element and can be used to access its DOM attributes and properties.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a very simple example to demonstrate this concept.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React, {useRef, useEffect} from 'react'\n\nconst RefExample = () =&gt; {\n  const headingRef = useRef('')\n  console.log(headingRef)\n  return(\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1 className='topheading' ref={headingRef}&gt;This is a h1 element&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\nexport default RefExample</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the example above, we defined <code>headingRef</code> using the <code>useRef</code> hook passing an empty string. We then set the ref in the <code>h1</code> tag by passing <code>ref  = {headingRef}</code>. By setting this ref, we have asked the <code>headingRef</code> to point to our <code>h1</code> element. This means that we can access the properties of our <code>h1</code> element from the ref.</p>\n\n<p>To see this, if we check the value of <code>console.log(headingRef)</code>, we’ll get <code>{current: HTMLHeadingElement}</code> or <code>{current: h1}</code> and we can assess all the properties or attributes of the element. A similar thing applies to any other HTML element.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, we could make the text italic when the component mounts.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">useEffect(() =&gt; {\n  headingRef.current.style.fontStyle = \"italic\";\n}, []);</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can even change the text to something else.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">...\n    headingRef.current.innerHTML = \"A Changed H1 Element\";\n...</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can even change the background color of the parent container as well.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">...\n    headingRef.current.parentNode.style.backgroundColor = \"red\";\n...</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any kind of DOM manipulation can be done here. Observe that <code>headingRef.current</code> can be read in the same way as  <code>document.querySelector('.topheading')</code>.</p>\n\n<p>One interesting use case of the <code>useRef</code> hook in manipulating the DOM element is to focus the cursor on the input element. Let’s quickly run through it.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useRef, useEffect} from 'react'\n\nconst inputRefExample = () =&gt; {\n  const inputRef = useRef(null)\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    inputRef.current.focus()\n  }, [])\n  \n  return(\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;input ref={inputRef} /&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick = {() =&gt; inputRef.current.focus()}&gt;Focus on Input &lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\nexport default inputRefExample</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, we created <code>inputRef</code> using the <code>useRef</code> hook and then asked it to point to the input element. We then made the cursor focus on the input ref when the component loads and when the button is clicked using <code>inputRef.current.focus()</code>. This is possible because <code>focus()</code> is an attribute of input elements and so the ref will be able to assess the methods.</p>\n\n<p>Refs created in a parent component can be assessed at the child component by forwarding it using <code>React.forwardRef()</code>. Let’s take a look at it.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s first create another component <code>NewInput.js</code> and add the following codes to it.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useRef, forwardRef } from \"react\";\nconst NewInput = forwardRef((props, ref) =&gt; {\n  return &lt;input placeholder={props.val} ref={ref} /&gt;;\n});\nexport default NewInput;</code></pre>\n\n<p>This component accepts <code>props</code> and <code>ref</code>. We passed the ref to its ref prop and <code>props.val</code> to its placeholder prop. Regular React components do not take a <code>ref</code> attribute. This attribute is available only when we wrap it with <code>React.forwardRef</code> as shown above.</p>\n\n<p>We can then easily call this in the parent component.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">...\n&lt;NewInput val=\"Just an example\" ref={inputRef} /&gt;\n...</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"storing-the-mutable-states\">Storing The Mutable States</h3>\n\n<p>Refs are not just used to manipulate DOM elements, they can also be used to store mutable values without re-rendering the entire component.</p>\n\n<p>The following example will detect the number of times a button is clicked without re-rendering the component.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useRef } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const countRef = useRef(0);\n  const increment = () =&gt; {\n    countRef.current++;\n    console.log(countRef);\n  };\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"App\"&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={increment}&gt;Increment &lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the code above, we incremented the <code>countRef</code> when the button is clicked and then logged it to the console. Although the value is incremented as shown in the console, we won’t be able to see any change if we try to assess it directly in our component. It will only update in the component when it re-renders.</p>\n\n<p>Note that while <code>useState</code> is asynchronous, <code>useRef</code> is synchronous. In other words, the value is available immediately after it is updated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-uselayouteffect-hook\">The <code>useLayoutEffect</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p>Like the <code>useEffect</code> hook, <code>useLayoutEffect</code> is called after the component is mounted and rendered. This hook fires after DOM mutation and it does so synchronously. Apart from getting called synchronously after DOM mutation, <code>useLayoutEffect</code> does the same thing as <code>useEffect</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>useLayoutEffect</code> should only be used for performing DOM mutation or DOM-related measurement, otherwise, you should use the <code>useEffect</code> hook. Using the <code>useEffect</code> hook for DOM mutation functions may cause some performance issues such as flickering but <code>useLayoutEffect</code> handles them perfectly as it runs after the mutations have occurred.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at some examples to demonstrate this concept.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We’ll be getting the width and height of the window on resize.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useState, useLayoutEffect} from 'react'\n\nconst ResizeExample = () =&gt;{\n  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState({width: 0, height: 0})\n  useLayoutEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const resizeWindow = () =&gt; setWindowSize({\n      width: window.innerWidth,\n      height: window.innerHeight\n    })\n    window.addEventListener('resize', resizeWindow)\n    return () =&gt; window.removeEventListener('resize', resizeWindow)\n  }, [])\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;width: {windowSize.width}&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;height: {windowSize.height}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\nexport default ResizeExample</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, we created a state <code>windowSize</code> with width and height properties. Then we set the state to the current window’s width and height respectively when the window is resized. We also cleaned up the code when it unmounts. The clean-up process is essential in <code>useLayoutEffect</code> to clean up the DOM manipulation and improve efficiency.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Let’s blur a text with <code>useLayoutEffect</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useRef, useState, useLayoutEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const paragraphRef = useRef(\"\");\n\n  useLayoutEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const { current } = paragraphRef;\n    const blurredEffect = () =&gt; {\n      current.style.color = \"transparent\";\n      current.style.textShadow = \"0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\";\n    };\n    current.addEventListener(\"click\", blurredEffect);\n    return () =&gt; current.removeEventListener(\"click\", blurredEffect);\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"App\"&gt;\n      &lt;p ref={paragraphRef}&gt;This is the text to blur&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>We used <code>useRef</code> and <code>useLayoutEffect</code> together in the above code. We first created a ref, <code>paragraphRef</code> to point to our paragraph. Then we created an on-click event listener to monitor when the paragraph is clicked and then blurred it using the style properties we defined. Finally, we cleaned up the event listener using <code>removeEventListener</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-usedispatch-and-useselector-hooks\">The <code>useDispatch</code> And <code>useSelector</code> Hooks</h2>\n\n<p><code>useDispatch</code> is a Redux hook for dispatching (triggering) actions in an application. It takes an action object as an argument and invokes the action. <code>useDispatch</code> is the hook’s equivalence to <code>mapDispatchToProps</code>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, <code>useSelector</code> is a Redux hook for assessing Redux states. It takes a function to select the exact Redux reducer from the store and then returns the corresponding states.</p>\n\n<p>Once our Redux store is connected to a React application through the Redux provider, we can invoke the actions with <code>useDispatch</code> and access the states with <code>useSelector</code>. Every Redux action and state can be assessed with these two hooks.</p>\n\n<p>Note that these states ship with React Redux (a package that makes assessing the Redux store easy in a React application). They are not available in the core Redux library.</p>\n\n<p>These hooks are very simple to use. First, we have to declare the dispatch function and then trigger it.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useDispatch, useSelector} from 'react-redux'\nimport {useEffect} from 'react'\nconst myaction from '...'\n\nconst ReduxHooksExample = () =&gt;{\n  const dispatch = useDispatch()\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    dispatch(myaction());\n    //alternatively, we can do this\n    dispatch({type: 'MY_ACTION_TYPE'})\n  }, [])       \n  \n  const mystate = useSelector(state =&gt; state.myReducerstate)\n  \n  return(\n    ...\n  )\n}\nexport default ReduxHooksExample</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, we imported <code>useDispatch</code> and <code>useSelector</code> from <code>react-redux</code>. Then, in a <code>useEffect</code> hook, we dispatched the action. We could define the action in another file and then call it here or we could define it directly as shown in the <code>useEffect</code> call.</p>\n\n<p>Once we have dispatched the actions, our states will be available. We can then retrieve the state using the <code>useSelector</code> hook as shown. The states can be used in the same way we would use states from the <code>useState</code> hook.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at an example to demonstrate these two hooks.</p>\n\n<p>To demonstrate this concept, we have to create a Redux store, reducer, and actions. To simplify things here, we’ll be using the Redux Toolkit library with our fake database from JSONPlaceholder.</p>\n\n<p>We need to install the following packages to get started. Run the following bash commands.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm i redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux axios</code></pre>\n\n<p>First, let’s create the <code>employeesSlice.js</code> to handle the reducer and action for our employees’ API.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { createAsyncThunk, createSlice } from \"@reduxjs/toolkit\";\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nconst endPoint = \"https://my-json-server.typicode.com/ifeanyidike/jsondata/employees\";\n\nexport const fetchEmployees = createAsyncThunk(\"employees/fetchAll\", async () =&gt; {\n    const { data } = await axios.get(endPoint);\n    return data;\n});\n\nconst employeesSlice = createSlice({\n  name: \"employees\",\n  initialState: { employees: [], loading: false, error: \"\" },\n  reducers: {},\n  extraReducers: {\n    [fetchEmployees.pending]: (state, action) =&gt; {\n      state.status = \"loading\";\n    },\n    [fetchEmployees.fulfilled]: (state, action) =&gt; {\n      state.status = \"success\";\n      state.employees = action.payload;\n    },\n    [fetchEmployees.rejected]: (state, action) =&gt; {\n      state.status = \"error\";\n      state.error = action.error.message;\n    }\n  }\n});\nexport default employeesSlice.reducer;</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the standard setup for the Redux toolkit. We used the <code>createAsyncThunk</code> to access the <code>Thunk</code> middleware to perform async actions. This allowed us to fetch the list of employees from the API. We then created the <code>employeesSlice</code> and returned, “loading”, “error”, and the employees’ data depending on the action types.</p>\n\n<p>Redux toolkit also makes setting up the store easy. Here is the store.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { configureStore } from \"@reduxjs/toolkit\";\nimport { combineReducers } from \"redux\";\nimport employeesReducer from \"./employeesSlice\";\n\nconst reducer = combineReducers({\n  employees: employeesReducer\n});\n\nexport default configureStore({ reducer });;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we used <code>combineReducers</code> to bundle the reducers and the <code>configureStore</code> function provided by Redux toolkit to set up the store.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s proceed to use this in our application.</p>\n\n<p>First, we need to connect Redux to our React application. Ideally, this should be done at the root of our application. I like to do it in the <code>index.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React, { StrictMode } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport store from \"./redux/store\";\nimport { Provider } from \"react-redux\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById(\"root\");\nReactDOM.render(\n  &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;\n    &lt;StrictMode&gt;\n      &lt;App /&gt;\n    &lt;/StrictMode&gt;\n  &lt;/Provider&gt;,\n  rootElement\n);</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, I’ve imported the store I created above and also <code>Provider</code> from <code>react-redux</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I wrapped the entire application with the <code>Provider</code> function, passing the store to it. This makes the store accessible throughout our application.</p>\n\n<p>We can then proceed to use the <code>useDispatch</code> and <code>useSelector</code> hooks to fetch the data.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s do this in our <code>App.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useDispatch, useSelector } from \"react-redux\";\nimport { fetchEmployees } from \"./redux/employeesSlice\";\nimport { useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    dispatch(fetchEmployees());\n  }, [dispatch]);\n  const employeesState = useSelector((state) =&gt; state.employees);\n  const { employees, loading, error } = employeesState;\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"App\"&gt;\n      {loading ? (\n        \"Loading...\"\n      ) : error ? (\n        &lt;div&gt;{error}&lt;/div&gt;\n      ) : (\n        &lt;&gt;\n          &lt;h1&gt;List of Employees&lt;/h1&gt;\n          {employees.map((employee) =&gt; (\n            &lt;div key={employee.id}&gt;\n              &lt;h3&gt;{`${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName}`}&lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          ))}\n        &lt;/&gt;\n      )}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, we used the <code>useDispatch</code> hook to invoke the <code>fetchEmployees</code> action created in the <code>employeesSlice.js</code> file. This makes the employees state to be available in our application. Then, we used the <code>useSelector</code> hook to get the states. Thereafter, we displayed the results by mapping through the <code>employees</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-usehistory-hook\">The <code>useHistory</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p>Navigation is very important in a React application. While you could achieve this in a couple of ways, React Router provides a simple, efficient and popular way to achieve dynamic routing in a React application. Furthermore, React Router provides a couple of hooks for assessing the state of the router and performing navigation on the browser but to use them, you need to first set up your application properly.</p>\n\n<p>To use any React Router hook, we should first wrap our application with <code>BrowserRouter</code>. We can then nest the routes with <code>Switch</code> and <code>Route</code>.</p>\n\n<p>But first, we have to install the package by running the following commands.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install react-router-dom</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, we need to set up our application as follows. I like to do this in my <code>App.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Employees from \"./components/Employees\";\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    &lt;div className=\"App\"&gt;\n      &lt;Router&gt;\n        &lt;Switch&gt;\n          &lt;Route path='/'&gt;\n            &lt;Employees /&gt;\n          &lt;/Route&gt;\n          ...\n        &lt;/Switch&gt;\n      &lt;/Router&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>We could have as many Routes as possible depending on the number of components we wish to render. Here, we have rendered only the <code>Employees</code> component. The <code>path</code> attribute tells React Router DOM the path of the component and can be assessed with query string or various other methods.</p>\n\n<p>The order matters here. The root route should be placed below the child route and so forth. To override this order, you need to include the <code>exact</code> keyword on the root route.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;Route path='/' exact &gt;\n  &lt;Employees /&gt;\n&lt;/Route&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now that we have set up the router, we can then use the <code>useHistory</code> hook and other React Router hooks in our application.</p>\n\n<p>To use the <code>useHistory</code> hook, we need to first declare it as follows.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useHistory} from 'history'\nimport {useHistory} from 'react-router-dom'\n\nconst Employees = () =&gt;{\n  const history = useHistory()\n  ...\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we log history to the console, we’ll see several properties associated with it. These include <code>block</code>, <code>createHref</code>, <code>go</code>, <code>goBack</code>, <code>goForward</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>listen</code>, <code>location</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>replace</code>. While all these properties are useful, you will most likely use <code>history.push</code> and <code>history.replace</code> more often than other properties.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s use this property to move from one page to another.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming we want to fetch data about a particular employee when we click on their names. We can use the <code>useHistory</code> hook to navigate to the new page where the employee’s information will be displayed.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function moveToPage = (id) =&gt;{\n  history.push(`/employees/${id}`)\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can implement this in our <code>Employee.js</code> file by adding the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport { Link, useHistory, useLocation } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nexport default function Employees() {\n  const history = useHistory();\n\n  function pushToPage = (id) =&gt; {\n    history.push(`/employees/${id}`)\n  }\n  ...\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n     ...\n        &lt;h1&gt;List of Employees&lt;/h1&gt;\n        {employees.map((employee) =&gt; (\n          &lt;div key={employee.id}&gt;\n            &lt;span&gt;{`${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName} `}&lt;/span&gt;\n            &lt;button onClick={pushToPage(employee.id)}&gt; &raquo; &lt;/button&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        ))}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the <code>pushToPage</code> function, we used <code>history</code> from the <code>useHistory</code> hook to navigate to the employee’s page and pass the employee id alongside.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-uselocation-hook\">The <code>useLocation</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p>This hook also ships with React Router DOM. It is a very popular hook used to work with the query string parameter. This hook is similar to the <code>window.location</code> in the browser.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useLocation} from 'react'\n\nconst LocationExample = () =&gt;{\n  const location = useLocation()\n  return (\n    ...\n  )\n}\nexport default LocationExample</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>useLocation</code> hook returns the <code>pathname</code>, <code>search</code> parameter, <code>hash</code> and <code>state</code>. The most commonly used parameters include the <code>pathname</code> and <code>search</code> but you could equally use <code>hash</code>, and <code>state</code> a lot in your application.</p>\n\n<p>The location <code>pathname</code> property will return the path we set in our <code>Route</code> set up. While <code>search</code> will return the query search parameter if any. For instance, if we pass <code>'http://mywebsite.com/employee/?id=1'</code> to our query, the <code>pathname</code> would be <code>/employee</code> and the <code>search</code> would be <code>?id=1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>We can then retrieve the various search parameters using packages like query-string or by coding them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-useparams-hook\">The <code>useParams</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p>If we set up our Route with a URL parameter in its path attribute, we can assess those parameters as key/value pairs with the <code>useParams</code> hook.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, let’s assume that we have the following Route.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&lt;Route path='/employees/:id' &gt;\n  &lt;Employees /&gt;\n&lt;/Route&gt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Route will be expecting a dynamic id in place of <code>:id</code>.</p>\n\n<p>With the <code>useParams</code> hook, we can assess the id passed by the user, if any.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, assuming the user passes the following in function with <code>history.push</code>,</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function goToPage = () =&gt; {\n  history.push(`/employee/3`)\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can use the <code>useParams</code> hook to access this URL parameter as follows.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useParams} from 'react-router-dom'\n\nconst ParamsExample = () =&gt;{\n  const params = useParams()\n  console.log(params)  \n\n  return(\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\nexport default ParamsExample</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we log <code>params</code> to the console, we’ll get the following object <code>{id: &quot;3&quot;}</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-useroutematch-hook\">The <code>useRouteMatch</code> Hook</h2>\n\n<p>This hook provides access to the match object. It returns the closest match to a component if no argument is supplied to it.</p>\n\n<p>The match object returns several parameters including the <code>path</code> (the same as the path specified in Route), the <code>URL</code>, <code>params</code> object, and <code>isExact</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, we can use <code>useRouteMatch</code> to return components based on the route.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useRouteMatch } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Employees from \"...\";\nimport Admin from \"...\"\n\nconst CustomRoute = () =&gt; {\n  const match = useRouteMatch(\"/employees/:id\");\n  return match ? (\n    &lt;Employee /&gt; \n  ) : (\n    &lt;Admin /&gt;\n  );\n};\nexport default CustomRoute;</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, we set a route’s path with <code>useRouteMatch</code> and then rendered the <code>&lt;Employee /&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Admin /&gt;</code> component depending on the route selected by the user.</p>\n\n<p>For this to work, we still need to add the route to our <code>App.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">...\n  &lt;Route&gt;\n    &lt;CustomRoute /&gt;\n  &lt;/Route&gt;\n...</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"building-a-custom-hook\">Building A Custom Hook</h2>\n\n<p>According to the React documentation, <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html\">building a custom hook allows us to extract a logic into a reusable function</a>. However, you need to make sure that all the rules that apply to React hooks apply to your custom hook. Check the rules of React hook at the top of this tutorial and ensure that your custom hook complies with each of them.</p>\n\n<p>Custom hooks allow us to write functions once and reuse them whenever they are needed and hence obeying the DRY principle.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, we could create a custom hook to get the scroll position on our page as follows.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import { useLayoutEffect, useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport const useScrollPos = () =&gt; {\n  const [scrollPos, setScrollPos] = useState({\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0\n  });\n  useLayoutEffect(() =&gt; {\n    const getScrollPos = () =&gt;\n      setScrollPos({\n        x: window.pageXOffset,\n        y: window.pageYOffset\n      });\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", getScrollPos);\n    return () =&gt; window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", getScrollPos);\n  }, []);\n  return scrollPos;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we defined a custom hook to determine the scroll position on a page. To achieve this, we first created a state, <code>scrollPos</code>, to store the scroll position. Since this will be modifying the DOM, we need to use <code>useLayoutEffect</code> instead of <code>useEffect</code>. We added a scroll event listener to capture the x and y scroll positions and then cleaned up the event listener. Finally, we returned to the scroll position.</p>\n\n<p>We can use this custom hook anywhere in our application by calling it and using it just as we would use any other state.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import {useScrollPos} from './Scroll'\n\nconst App = () =&gt;{\n  const scrollPos = useScrollPos()\n  console.log(scrollPos.x, scrollPos.y)\n  return (\n    ...\n  )\n}\nexport default App</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we imported the custom hook <code>useScrollPos</code> we created above. Then we initialized it and then logged the value to our console. If we scroll on the page, the hook will show us the scroll position at every step of the scroll.</p>\n\n<p>We can create custom hooks to do just about anything we can imagine in our app. As you can see, we simply need to use the inbuilt React hook to perform some functions. We can also use third-party libraries to create custom hooks but if we do so, we will have to install that library to be able to use the hook.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>In this tutorial, we took a good look at some useful React hooks you will be using in most of your applications. We examined what they present and how to use them in your application. We also looked at several code examples to help you understand these hooks and apply them to your application.</p>\n\n<p>I encourage you to try these hooks in your own application to understand them more.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"resources-from-the-react-docs\">Resources From The React Docs</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html\">Hooks FAQ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk\">Redux Toolkit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html\">Using the State Hook</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html\">Using the Effect Hook</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html\">Hooks API Reference</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks\">React Redux Hooks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks\">React Router Hooks</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"signature\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/logo/logo--red.png\" alt=\"Smashing Editorial\" width=\"35\" height=\"46\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" />\n  <span>(ks, vf, yk, il)</span>\n</div>\n\n\n              </article>\n            </body>\n          </html>\n        "

With the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/\">WooCommerce plugin</a> and a WordPress theme installed, you can easily launch a functional ecommerce store. </p>\n<p>That said, WordPress has <a href=\"https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/\">11,000 themes</a> from Theme Forest alone. So, how do you choose which one is best for your business?</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ve compiled a list of ecommerce WordPress themes to make your search easier. </p>\n<h2 id=\"howtochoosetheidealwordpresstheme\">How to Choose the Ideal WordPress Theme</h2>\n<p>Before anything else, you need to know the factors to consider when choosing a WordPress theme. Below are a few to keep in mind.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compatibilitywithwoocommerce\">Compatibility with WooCommerce</h3>\n<p>The first step is to check whether the theme is compatible with WooCommerce. While most WordPress themes can fit the bill, a theme made specifically for ecommerce stores lets you create seamless home or product pages in an instant. </p>\n<h3 id=\"responsiveness\">Responsiveness</h3>\n<p>Mobile-friendliness is a crucial factor when choosing from hundreds of themes. It ensures visitors have a smooth user experience whether browsing through multiple devices like smartphones, tablets or PCs. </p>\n<h3 id=\"aesthetic\">Aesthetic</h3>\n<p>Consider a theme that aesthetically matches the look and feel of your brand. Some themes appear elegant, while others have a modern style. There are also themes built primarily for groceries, fashion retailers, or artisans — so choose the option that&#8217;s the best fit for your business. </p>\n<h3 id=\"seooptimization\">SEO optimization</h3>\n<p>People won’t flock to your website if you’re not viewed favorably by Google. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, many themes offer built-in SEO features such as fast-loading times, easy navigation, headings and subheadings, and meta descriptions. Keep in mind the factors that affect the <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-to-wordpress-seo/\">SEO friendliness</a> of your website. Otherwise, you’ll have trouble attracting more customers to your store. </p>\n<h3 id=\"browsingbehavior\">Browsing behavior</h3>\n<p>Think about your browsing and buying behavior of your customers. </p>\n<p>Will it be beneficial to showcase high-quality product photos? Select a theme that could display large product photos or integrate features like zoom and carousel for easy inspection. Do you want to focus on getting more conversions? Choose a theme with a distraction-free checkout option and strategic call-to-action buttons. </p>\n<p>Put yourself in your customers’ shoes to understand the key features that will make or break their online shopping experience. </p>\n<h2 id=\"freewordpressecommercethemes\">Free WordPress Ecommerce Themes</h2>\n<p>Which theme to pick?

Companies are regularly updating and improving their products to meet these challenges and are looking to recruit new talent. Are you looking to participate in newer projects within your company? Are you looking to switch employers or careers? Do your skills match the job description? If they don&#8217;t, but you&#8217;re keen to explore new possibilities, read on.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"benefitsofupdatingyourengineeringskills\">Benefits of Updating Your Engineering Skills</h2>\n<p>To keep up with rapid technology changes, you have to be current with your skills. With newer skills, you&#8217;ll have greater success in looking for a new career or being recruited to other projects. A new career often comes with the side benefit of a higher salary. </p>\n<p>With more skills under your belt, you&#8217;re more likely to be noticed and recruited for more projects within your organization. If you&#8217;re certified in a particular discipline, you&#8217;re more likely to be trusted and hired for specific expertise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"companysponsoredinitiatives\">Company-sponsored Initiatives</h2>\n<h3 id=\"tuitionassistance\">Tuition Assistance</h3>\n<p>Many companies offer tuition reimbursement as part of the employee benefits package. According to <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/tuition-assistance-companies/\">Glassdoor&#8217;s 2020 report</a>, some companies offer partial to full tuition assistance, with either the employee or the employer choosing an educational institution. The amount ranges from $500 to $10,000 per year, and may extend to both full-time and part-time employees. <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-T-Mobile-EI_IE9302.11,19.htm\">T-Mobile</a>, for instance, offers to cover the full tuition bill for full-time workers at designated online universities and partial tuition assistance for both full-time and part-time employees at other institutions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"negotiationandcommitment\">Negotiation and Commitment</h3>\n<p>As the requirements for financial assistance vary among employers, talk to your boss about your career goals and obtain permission and sponsorship to acquire your next set of skills. As pursuing education may interfere with your work schedule, offer to take these courses in the evenings or weekends if available. </p>\n<p>Prepare a list of convincing arguments why your employer should invest in your education and how you will benefit your employer in the long run. Be grateful and commit to remaining with your employer after you finish your program. Some companies may require you to sign a contract to solidify your commitment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jobcertificationandlegality\">Job Certification and Legality</h3>\n<p>Some jobs may require you to be certified to perform your tasks. In this case, you can earn while you learn because, as a non-exempt employee, you should be remunerated for your learning and preparation time toward certification. </p>\n<p>Check out some <a href=\"https://www.vigilant.org/employment-law-blog/qa-do-i-need-to-pay-employees-for-their-time-spent-studying\">legal requirements</a> to ensure that your training is necessary, your learning and training are conducted during working hours, and productive work is being performed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"internaltraining\">Internal Training</h3>\n<p>The range of skills you&#8217;re looking to acquire may be obtained within the company or outside. Amazon, for example, offers <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/\">training and certification</a> programs in cloud computing for internal employees as well as customers and partners. Tech giants such as Google have been known to support <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/googler-2-how-google-mastered-p2p-learning-rahul-bhatt/\">peer-to-peer employee learning programs</a> or mentoring to foster camaraderie and build employee growth. AT&amp;T boasts of its internal <a href=\"https://www.att.jobs/article-employee-takeover-nova-kopp\">AT&#038;T University</a> to encourage employee learning while on the job to boost their skill sets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"externaltraining\">External Training</h3>\n<p>Companies like AT&amp;T invest in <a href=\"https://learn.att.jobs/app/advanced-learning-partners\">employee-retraining programs</a> through collaboration with partners such as Udacity, Coursera, University of Notre Dame, and Georgia Tech, to offer advanced degree and certification programs in the latest technologies. </p>\n<p>By participating in company-sponsored employee learning programs, you can align your skills to your company&#8217;s goals and objectives. Your organization may be teaming up with other companies to sponsor or lead conferences relevant to your industry. Be on the lookout for these avenues, as they&#8217;ll help you network with others and pick up additional skills.</p>\n<h3 id=\"onlinedevelopercommunities\">Online Developer Communities</h3>\n<p>As a software engineer, part of your role is to research before you design a solution. When you&#8217;re researching and planning, you encounter novel ideas and learn new wisdom along the way. Though unofficial, this is an accepted method of acquiring a new skill set while you&#8217;re on the job. While working on your project, you may encounter stumbling blocks. You may be able to find answers within your cohort. </p>\n<p>Otherwise, you can always explore the question-and-answer repository on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com\">Stack Overflow</a>. Chances are, you may be able to pick up some beautiful gems and knowledge from others&#8217; experiences. You&#8217;re learning and getting paid for this research while working.</p>\n<h2 id=\"selfsponsoredinitiatives\">Self-sponsored Initiatives</h2>\n<h3 id=\"freelearningresources\">Free Learning Resources</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a freelancer and ineligible for your current employer&#8217;s benefits, you can still expand your engineering skill set. You can learn from free developer teaching websites, such as <a href=\"http://w3schools.com\">w3schools</a> and <a href=\"http://freecodecamp.org\">freeCodeCamp</a>. These resources will allow you to gain extra knowledge on your own time. </p>\n<p>In addition to free courses, freeCodeCamp offers <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-curriculum-is-live/\">free certifications</a> on full-stack web development with JavaScript, including responsive design, front-end libraries, data structures and algorithms, data visualization, API and microservices, and quality assurance, as well as Python certifications in scientific computing, data analysis, information security, and machine learning. </p>\n<h3 id=\"technologycertification\">Technology Certification</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in cloud computing, take a look at the many offerings from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/certification/\">Amazon</a> offers professional certifications for AWS as a cloud practitioner, solutions architect, developer, SysOps administrator, DevOps engineer, and other specialties. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science have dominated much of the technology spheres. </p>\n<p>You can obtain certifications for these popular fields at <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/certification/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"http://udacity.com\">Udacity</a>, and <a href=\"http://datacamp.com\">DataCamp</a>. If you&#8217;re an experienced relational database designer looking to explore NoSQL alternatives, investigate the various offerings and certifications available at <a href=\"https://university.mongodb.com/certification\">MongoDB University</a>. </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-expand-your-engineering-skill-set-without-quitting-your-day-job/?utm_source=rss\">How to Expand Your Engineering Skill Set Without Quitting Your Day Job</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

In this article, we&#8217;ll show you tips on internationalization and localization, as well as improving the SEO of your internationalized website.</strong></p>\n<p>The acronym GILT (globalization, internationalization, localization and translation) refers to the process businesses undergo to move beyond their national boundaries and cater to international markets.</p>\n<p>During the internationalization process, business owners look for tips to boost their website traffic. They follow SEO best practices, find strategic keywords and monitor their results. But there&#8217;s a little-known technique that you might have underestimated in the process of internationalization: translating your website.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2021, English was the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/266808/the-most-spoken-languages-worldwide/?utm_source=weglot&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_campaign=multilingual-website-growth-data\">most used language worldwide</a>, because it had 1.35 billion speakers. But English is only used by around <a href=\"https://blog.weglot.com/top-multilingual-website-stats-and-website-localization-trends-2021/\">25%</a> of global internet users.</p>\n<p>Technology makes it possible for merchants to ensure their site&#8217;s user interface can support a foreign region or language. As such, merchants that aim for internationalization should consider translating their website, especially if they&#8217;re capable of worldwide shipping. That way, their business or companies can expand on a much bigger scale.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for tips on the internationalization and localization process, here’s what you need to know.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarewebsiteinternationalizationandlocalization\">What Are Website Internationalization and Localization?</h2>\n<p>Internationalization is the process that involves ensuring your site can accommodate multiple languages and have the appropriate website architecture to do so.</p>\n<p>During the website design and development phase, internationalization may entail having larger character encodings to fit foreign scripts. Likewise, the user interface must have ample space to accommodate the number of letters required for Chinese, Korean, or Russian characters. It should also be able to cater to languages that require individuals to read from right to left, instead of the usual left to right format.</p>\n<p>For instance, IKEA&#8217;s internationalized instructional manual has simple and clear illustrations that make it easy for consumers to understand the setup process, regardless of their nationality.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631520874ikea-assembly.jpeg\" alt=\"IKEA assembly instructions\" /></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, localization is the process of making a product or message resonate with your specific target market. It ensures the site and your marketing messages abide by cultural factors and practices in the area.</p>\n<p>For example, a localized product page must use the appropriate system of measurement, follow legal requirements, use local currencies, number formats, and so on.</p>\n<p>The process of internationalization and localization of materials is often abbreviated as i18n and L10n.</p>\n<p>Localization and internationalization can improve your communication with consumers across the world. This process is definitely an advantage in markets where consumers use different languages, such as European or Asian countries.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofwebsitelocalizationandinternationalization\">The Benefits of Website Localization and Internationalization</h2>\n<p>Billions of people across the world are non-native speakers. Thus, ecommerce merchants that want to widen their reach and boost their appeal in a foreign locale should consider adopting a multilingual website.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the perks of internationalization and localization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1internationalizationletsyoucompeteagainstlocalbusinesses\">1. Internationalization lets you compete against local businesses</h3>\n<p>An internationalized website lets merchants compete with local businesses across the world where English is not the main language.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, consumers prefer websites that speak to them in their own native tongue. An interesting study found <a href=\"https://blog.weglot.com/top-multilingual-website-stats-and-website-localization-trends-2021/\">73% of shoppers</a> prefer to purchase from a website that uses their own language.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2internationalizationandlocalizationcanboostsearchability\">2. Internationalization and localization can boost searchability</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you wanted to expand your ecommerce business to France and Spain.</p>\n<p>Shoppers in these markets use their own native language when typing in search results. So if your website isn&#8217;t translated, they won&#8217;t be able to find your product pages on Google.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this scenario, localization and internationalization boost your searchability. Without i18n and L10n, your chances of adapting to international markets will be slim.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id=\"3internationalizationcanincreasesales\">3. Internationalization can increase sales</h3>\n<p>The localization process can help increase conversion rates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lingmointernational.com/blog/6-ways-a-multilingual-website-can-increase-web-traffic/\">46% of website users</a> state that the localized content is perceived as more trustworthy, which increases their likelihood of buying from the brand.</p>\n<p>In fact, businesses that have undergone the localization process have achieved enviable results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lifestyle clothing brand La Machine Cycle Club <a href=\"https://weglot.com/customers/la-machine-cycle-club/\">increased conversion rates by 25%</a> through the localization of their site in three languages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Likewise, Swedish ecommerce brand Ron Dorff&#8217;s localization involved the translation of 150 product pages into three languages. As a result, they increased international sales by 70% and <a href=\"https://weglot.com/customers/ron-dorff/\">increased traffic by 400%</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These success stories prove that localization and internationalization can have a big impact on your sales. Because you can communicate with consumers better, you can achieve higher rates of conversion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4internationalizationandlocalizationisacosteffectivecustomeracquisitiontactic\">4. Internationalization and localization is a cost-effective customer acquisition tactic</h3>\n<p>Website internationalization and localization don&#8217;t have to be expensive endeavors. Software and <a href=\"https://weglot.com/\">WordPress plugins</a> like <a href=\"https://weglot.com/\">Weglot</a> can translate your website at minimal cost — and they&#8217;re extremely affordable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"9strategiesforsuccessfulwebsitelocalizationandinternationalization\">9 Strategies for Successful Website Localization and Internationalization</h2>\n<p>What are the steps involved in the process of adapting to international consumers? Here are the best practices for a successful internationalization process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1researchthespecifictargetmarket\">1. Research the specific target market</h3>\n<p>International consumers use different search terms, slang, or phrases when scouring deals, bargains, and cool products. Likewise, they may also have different customs or practices when buying a product or service.</p>\n<p>That means you&#8217;ll need to research your target market and analyze your competitors. We highly recommend getting in touch with native marketers, SEO specialists, or agencies to guide you through the process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2translateseoelements\">2. Translate SEO elements</h3>\n<p>Before people check out your landing page, they assess meta descriptions and SEO titles. If these pages aren&#8217;t translated into their native language, you&#8217;re less likely to end up on the top search results.</p>\n<p>For example, when typing &#8220;김치&#8221; or kimchi in Google, the top search results are pages with a Korean title and description. That means when these elements aren&#8217;t translated, you may unknowingly turn people away.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631520861kimchi.jpg\" alt=\"Kimchi google search Korea\" /></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s precisely why the recommendation is to translate the following SEO elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>title</li>\n<li>meta description</li>\n<li>image alt tags</li>\n<li>URL</li>\n</ul>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/internationalization-multilingual-site/?utm_source=rss\">Internationalization: How to Boost Traffic with a Multilingual Site</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

You&#8217;ve heard great things about how customizable and intuitive it is, but staring at a blank page leaves you feeling overwhelmed? Don&#8217;t worry, as this guide will get you quickly up to speed and ready to dig deeper. Be prepared, though: once you&#8217;re hooked, you&#8217;ll find plenty of rabbit holes to dive into!</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"getthemacwindowsandmobileappsforyourdevices\">Get the Mac, Windows and Mobile Apps for Your Devices</h2>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t yet have Notion on your desktop, you&#8217;ll want to download it (for <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/desktop\">Mac or PC</a>). The browser version works just fine, and can be handy if you want to have multiple pages open at once, but putting the app on your desktop helps it earn its rightful place in your digital ecosystem. </p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also want to download the app on your <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/mobile\">iPhone or Android device</a>. and iPad if you&#8217;re using one. The app lends itself more to desktop use, but you&#8217;ll want the tool handy on all your devices if you&#8217;re going to use it to its full potential. The iOS and Android apps are definitely handy for on the go. The iPad app does give you access to your pages but leaves something to be desired. The Notion team has acknowledged as much, and is promising that mobile improvements are on the roadmap.</p>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve created an account (a breeze with SSI from Google) you&#8217;ll want to download the web clipper in order to pull web pages directly into Notion. Notion&#8217;s own <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/web-clipper\">Web Clipper</a> is handy, but an even better option is the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-notion/ldmmifpegigmeammaeckplhnjbbpccmm\">Save to Notion</a> extension, which allows you to add metadata to the entry right at capture!

Just like legos, you piece blocks together to create whatever you can imagine.</p>\n<p>Each block type can be moved, duplicated and formatted. Even more exciting is that every individual block has a unique link, making it easy to cross reference blocks across your system. </p>\n<p>Basic blocks include the standard elements of word processors such as text, headers, bulleted and numbered lists. There are also &#8220;to-do lists&#8221; (checkboxes), quotes and call-outs to draw attention to important text, dividers, nested pages and links to existing pages. </p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll stick to basic block types in this article (this is a 101 guide, after all) but other block categories include inline mentions, media and embeds, databases and advanced blocks like breadcrumbs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630050220basic-blocks.png\" alt=\"Basic block types, such as text, page, to-do list and headings\" width=\"638\" height=\"478\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-203032\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630050220basic-blocks.png 638w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630050220basic-blocks-300x225.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"putittogetherwithpages\">Put it together with Pages</h3>\n<p>Think of pages as Google Docs — except you can build them out of all sorts of blocks, customizing the layout, formatting and contents with ease. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630050317new-page.png\" alt=\"A new page\" width=\"1434\" height=\"738\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-203034\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630050317new-page.png 1434w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630050317new-page-300x154.png 300w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630050317new-page-1024x527.png 1024w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630050317new-page-768x395.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1434px) 100vw, 1434px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"organizeitwithtables\">Organize it with Tables</h3>\n<p>Tables are your replacement for Excel or Google Sheets — unless you&#8217;re using pivot tables or performing complicated data analysis. <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/guides/table-view-databases\">Add meta data</a> with the usual properties including text, numbers, and formulas.

Yes, there are standard text and bulleted lists, but you can also organize things within toggles, create a quick to-do list with check boxes or even embed video, images and web bookmarks.</p>\n<p>The real beauty of blocks is the ability to combine them however you choose! This means you can create dashboards and <a href=\"https://radreads.co/notion-wiki/\">personal wikis</a> with ease. Since Notion was built for building, embeds are easy to create and move (none of the lag you&#8217;ll find in a Google or Word doc). It&#8217;s also super easy to drag and drop any block, change a block from one type to another, or duplicate it. </p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t stop there. Create columns to organize blocks (drag until you see the blue line move next to the existing block). Use colors, emojis and images to customize your page. Use quotes and callouts to draw attention to specific text (great for sharing instructions on how to navigate a page!). Once you get the hang of things, you can create dashboards for planning your work and life!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630127816making-columns.jpeg\" alt=\"Making columns\" width=\"1000\" height=\"344\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-203052\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630127816making-columns.jpeg 1000w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630127816making-columns-300x103.jpeg 300w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630127816making-columns-768x264.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/notion-beginners-guide/?utm_source=rss\">Notion Guide: All-in-One Workspace & Notes App</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

We&#8217;ll discuss the advantages of using the <a href=\"https://nx.dev/\">Nx</a> development tools for managing a monorepo, and learn how to use those tools to build a <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> application.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The code for this article is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/nx-nextjs-monorepo\">GitHub</a>. You can find a working demo of the app we&#8217;re building <a href=\"https://nx-nextjs-monorepo.vercel.app/\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatamonorepoisandwhyweshouldconsiderusingone\">What a Monorepo Is, and Why We Should Consider Using One</h2>\n<p>A <strong>monorepo</strong> is a single repository that contains the apps, tools and configurations of multiple projects or project components. It&#8217;s an alternative to creating separate repositories for each project or part of a project.</p>\n<p>Consider a scenario where we&#8217;re building a dashboard application using some front-end library or framework. The code for this front-end application might be stored in the <code>dashboard</code> repository. The UI components that this repository uses might be stored in another repository named <code>components</code>. Now, every time we update the <code>components</code> repository, we&#8217;d have to go into the <code>dashboard</code> repository and update the <code>components</code> dependency.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1626026159separated.png\" alt=\"Two repositories - dashboard and components\" /></p>\n<p>To alleviate this problem, we could merge the <code>components</code> repo with the <code>dashboard</code> repo.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1626026158mono-repo-single.png\" alt=\"Components repo merged into dashboard repo\" /></p>\n<p>However, there might be another front-end application for the marketing site that&#8217;s stored in the <code>marketing</code> repository and which depends on <code>components</code> repository. So, we&#8217;ll have to duplicate <code>components</code> and merge it with <code>marketing</code> as well. However, because of this, any change related to <code>components</code> will have to be made in two places, which isn&#8217;t ideal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1626026155double-mono-repo.png\" alt=\"Dashboard and marketing repos, each with a copy of components\" /></p>\n<p>The above issue can be resolved by using a monorepo, where the <code>dashboard</code>, <code>components</code> and <code>marketing</code> components reside in one single repository.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1626026156mono-repo-all.png\" alt=\"Monorepo containing dashboard, marketing and components\" /></p>\n<p>There are various advantages of using a monorepo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updating of packages is much easier, since all applications and libraries are inside a single repository. Since all applications and packages are under the same repository, adding new code or modifying existing code can be easily tested and shipped.</li>\n<li>Refactoring of code is much easier, as we&#8217;ll only have to do it in a single place instead of replicating the same stuff across multiple repositories.</li>\n<li>A monorepo allows for onsistent configuration for CI/CD pipelines, which can be reused by all the applications and libraries present in the same repository.</li>\n<li>Publishing of packages also becomes much easier, due to tools like Nx.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://nx.dev/latest/react/getting-started/nx-cli\">Nx CLI</a> will help us in generating new Next.js applications and React component libraries. It will also help us in running a development web server with hot module reload. It can also do a bunch of other important things like <a href=\"https://nx.dev/latest/react/guides/eslint\">linting, formatting</a> and <a href=\"https://nx.dev/latest/react/generators/using-schematics\">generating code</a>. The advantage of using a CLI like this that it will provide a sense of standardization in our codebase. As our codebase grows, it&#8217;s very difficult to manage and understand the underlying complexities. Nx CLI takes away most of those complexities by providing tools to automate the generation of code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"softwarerequired\">Software Required</h2>\n<p>We’ll need the following installed for the purposes of running our app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">npm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/\">Yarn</a> (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These technologies will be used in the app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> for building our app</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://styled-components.com/\">Styled Components</a> for adding styles to our app</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: you can read more about <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">how to install multiple versions of Node.js using nvm</a> if you want to get up to speed with that.</em></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll also need a <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/\">Product Hunt</a> account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installingandbootstrappingannxworkspace\">Installing and Bootstrapping an Nx Workspace</h2>\n<p>We can install the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nrwl/cli\">Nx CLI</a> using the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install nx -g\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above command will install the Nx CLI globally. This is useful because now we can create a new Next.js application using this CLI from any directory.</p>\n<p>Next, we need to run the following command inside the directory where we want to create our monorepo:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx create-nx-workspace@latest nx-nextjs-monorepo\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above command will create an Nx workspace. All Nx applications can reside inside an Nx workspace.</p>\n<p>You might need to replace <code>nx-nextjs-monorepo</code> with the name of your workspace. It can be named anything you like. The name of the workspace is generally the name of an organization, company, etc.</p>\n<p>When we run the above command, we&#8217;ll be given a set of steps that will create what type of applications we want to create with Nx.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> It will first ask what type of application we want to create. We&#8217;ll select Next.js from the list of options.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16248510831.png\" alt=\"Create a workspace\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> It will ask us for the name of the application we want to create. We can call it anything. In this case, we&#8217;ll name it as &#8220;product-hunt&#8221;.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16248510872.png\" alt=\"Enter the application name\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> It will ask us what type of stylesheet we want to use. We&#8217;ll choose Styled Components.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16248510913.png\" alt=\"Enter the default stylesheet format\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> It will ask us if we want to use <a href=\"https://nx.app/\">Nx Cloud</a>, which is a platform for speeding up the builds of Nx applications. In this case, we&#8217;ll choose No, but please check it out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16248510954.png\" alt=\"Use Nx Cloud?\" /></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nx will now scaffold all the files and directories and generate the following structure for us.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/16248510985_1.png\" alt=\"Directory structure\" /></p>\n<p>The <code>apps</code> directory contains all our applications. In our case, this directory will contain the Next.js application that we&#8217;re building (named <code>product-hunt</code>). This directory also contains the end-to-end test applications (named <code>product-hunt-e2e</code>) scaffolded using <a href=\"https://www.cypress.io/\">Cypress</a>.</p>\n<p>The <code>libs</code> directory contains all the libraries like components, utility functions, and so on. These libraries can be used by any of the applications present in the <code>apps</code> directory.</p>\n<p>The <code>tools</code> directory contains all the custom scripts, codemods, and so on, which are used to make certain modifications to our codebase.</p>\n<p><em>Note: more information regarding the directory structure is available <a href=\"https://nx.dev/latest/react/getting-started/nx-setup\">here</a>.</em></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/monorepo-nx-next-typescript/?utm_source=rss\">How to Build a Monorepo with Nx, Next.js and TypeScript</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Like making appointments, booking reservations, and signing up for events.</strong> </p>\n<p>As antiquated solutions like phone-based reservation systems and basic contact forms grow more and more out of favor, what exactly do consumers want in 2021? In other words, what should the online booking systems that you build for your clients’ companies look like? </p>\n<p>Today, we’re going to look at four modern booking trends and how you can use <a href=\"https://trafft.com/?utm_source=sitepoint.com&#038;utm_medium=article&#038;utm_campaign=july21\">Trafft</a> to build higher-converting online booking systems that exceed consumers’ — and your clients’ — expectations. </p>\n<h2 id=\"4moderntrendsinonlinebookingsystems\">4 Modern Trends in Online Booking Systems</h2>\n<p>As of writing this, Millennials are the generation with the greatest spending power. Generation Z isn’t too far behind. </p>\n<p>Why does this matter? Well, if a brand can’t keep up in terms of technological preferences and demands, they’re bound to lose favor with these powerful consumers. And considering that the majority of Millennials and Gen Zers are attached to their screens for a good part of the day, online booking systems need to be delivered in a manner that makes the most sense for them. </p>\n<p>In order to keep up with modern demand, there are four trends you can use to build better online booking systems that convert well. </p>\n<h3 id=\"trend1smartefficientbookingprocesses\">Trend 1: Smart, efficient booking processes</h3>\n<p>Booking systems have undergone some much-needed changes over the last decade. That’s because older booking systems were costly to manage and support. Plus, there was just too much friction within the user experience. </p>\n<p>Customers got stuck on hold. Or had to wait for someone to help them coordinate their booking. Or their appointment got misplaced due to a clerical error. It was frustrating for customers and time-consuming for businesses. </p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://trafft.com/?utm_source=sitepoint.com&#038;utm_medium=article&#038;utm_campaign=july21\">Trafft</a> booking system removes these complexities from the booking experience. </p>\n<p>For starters, customers want to know what all their options are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>locations</li>\n<li>providers</li>\n<li>services or events</li>\n<li>days and times</li>\n<li>cost</li>\n<li>payment type</li>\n<li>and more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this can be programmed into your online booking system with <a href=\"https://trafft.com/?utm_source=sitepoint.com&#038;utm_medium=article&#038;utm_campaign=july21\">Trafft</a> so the customer can work out the logistics of their booking on their own and in a matter of minutes. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trafft.com/?utm_source=sitepoint.com&#038;utm_medium=article&#038;utm_campaign=july21\"><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16278677301.gif\" alt=\"using Trafft\" /></a></p>\n<p><!-- <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16278677301.gif\" alt=\"using Trafft\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-201312\" /> --></p>\n<p>What’s more, you can set rules behind the scenes related to things like: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>business days, hours, holidays, and so on</li>\n<li>appointment buffers</li>\n<li>event criteria and limits</li>\n<li>time zones</li>\n<li>employee availability</li>\n<li>pre-payments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This helps your clients avoid those embarrassing calls where they have to ask customers to reschedule because the booking they made isn’t actually available. </p>\n<p>What’s more, once the booking is made online, the appointment guidelines you define take care of the rest. Bookings go on the customer’s and employee’s calendars. Reminder emails and SMSs go out. Location space is scheduled. And so on. </p>\n<p>It’s super efficient and less prone to errors and frustration than the systems of the past.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trend2bookingformsdesignedforshorterattentionspans\">Trend 2: Booking forms designed for shorter attention spans</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190415081959.htm\">A 2019 study out of the Technical University of Denmark</a> found that our collective attention span is shrinking year by year. This is due to the abundance of information available online.</p>\n<p>So, while it’s important for online booking forms to give users options, it needs to be presented in a simplified manner. If it looks complicated or time-consuming, you’re bound to see more drop-offs than bookings. </p>\n<p>Just keep in mind that minimal is not the same thing as sparse. </p>\n<p>Tech-savvy consumers might feel comfortable and confident with a fast-tracked booking process, but others might not be. If the brevity of your form compromises their trust in the process or in the credibility of the company, that can be just as problematic. So, be careful not to cut corners. </p>\n<p>That’s why it’s important to build a form that asks for the minimum while still capturing all of the information you need from the user. At the same time, you should educate them or provide additional context when it makes sense to do so. </p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://trafft.com/?utm_source=sitepoint.com&#038;utm_medium=article&#038;utm_campaign=july21\">Trafft</a>, your booking process will get broken up into small, easily digestible steps. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trafft.com/?utm_source=sitepoint.com&#038;utm_medium=article&#038;utm_campaign=july21\"><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16278744742.png\" alt=\"small steps\" /></a></p>\n<p><!-- <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16278744742.png\" alt=\"small steps\" width=\"1440\" height=\"789\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-201318\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16278744742.png 1440w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16278744742-300x164.png 300w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16278744742-1024x561.png 1024w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16278744742-768x421.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /> --></p>\n<p>This will make it easier for users to complete the form, as they’re asked to only complete one small task at a time. </p>\n<p>You can change the order of steps based on what makes the most sense for your customers. A/B testing will help you find the most logical and ideal order of steps if you’re unsure. </p>\n<p>Inputting information into the form is simplified as well. Whether the form calls for customer to click on and select a calendar date and time, or to add their contact info, the steps needed to complete an action are quick and easy to execute. </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/online-booking-system-trends/?utm_source=rss\">4 Trends for Modernizing An Online Booking System in 2021</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

It&#8217;s a mature, full-featured, flexible and open-source framework that lets you build anything from a simple CRUD application to a more complex, multi-app project like a <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/django-photo-sharing-app/\">photo-sharing app</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"requirements\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need previous knowledge to set up a Django project. But Django is a Python framework, so to use it you should have <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/learn-programming-fundamentals-with-python-2916\">strong foundations using Python</a>.</p>\n<p>Before starting, make sure you have a terminal or command prompt with Python 3.6 or later installed.</p>\n<p>Most macOS and Linux systems have Python 3 installed by default, but if you&#8217;re using Windows, you&#8217;ll need to download and install <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\">Python</a>. You can follow this guide from the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html\">official Python website</a>.</p>\n<p>You can open a terminal by opening the applications finder of your operating system and searching for <em>Terminal</em>, or on Windows, <em>cmd</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635828763Open-terminal.png\" alt=\"Open a terminal with application finder\" /></p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve set up a terminal, it&#8217;s time to confirm your Python version. To do this, type the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">python --version\r\n\r\nPython 3.9.7 # My result\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you didn’t get a result of the form Python 3.x, don&#8217;t panic. There are two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>if <code>python --version</code> returned a Python 2.x version, you’ll need to use <code>python3</code> along with this tutorial. This usually happens with some macOS systems, as well as with some <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/anonymous-linux-distros/\">Linux distros</a> like Ubuntu. Try running the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">python3 --version\r\n\r\nPython 3.9.7 # Again, my result\r\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if you got an <code>Unknown command</code> error, tried to run <code>python3</code>, and still got another error, you&#8217;ll need to download and install Python from the official website.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that you know what Python command to run in your terminal, let&#8217;s dive into Django projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsadjangoproject\">What&#8217;s a Django Project?</h2>\n<p>A Django project is a Python package needed to make a web application work. It contains everything you need to build the backend (server-side development, what the users don&#8217;t see) of your site. The normal functionality of a Django project determines how you interact with the database, authentication, how data is retrieved, and so on.</p>\n<p>You can also think of it as a collection of settings, and small Python modules named apps. We&#8217;ll talk about them later, but as a pre-concept, an app is another set of Python files that solve a specific task of your app.</p>\n<p>Through this article, you&#8217;ll learn about the sophisticated structure of a Django project. But from the start I want you to know that a Django project can be narrowed down to a single file, something similar to a <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/flask-masses/\">Flask</a> project.</p>\n<p>A quick demonstration of this is the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/rnevius/minimal-django\">Minimal Django</a> project. This is a file with 23 lines of code that allows us to bring a Django &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; project to life:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">import sys\r\n\r\nfrom django.conf import settings\r\nfrom django.urls import path\r\nfrom django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\r\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\r\n\r\nsettings.configure(\r\n    DEBUG=True,\r\n    ROOT_URLCONF=sys.modules[__name__],\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef index(request):\r\n    return HttpResponse('&lt;h1&gt;A minimal Django response!&lt;/h1&gt;')\r\n\r\n\r\nurlpatterns = [\r\n    path(r'', index),\r\n]\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, a Django project can go much further. A great example is Instagram, which has thousands of Django endpoints and still uses this framework for crucial functionality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtosetupadjangoproject\">How to Set up a Django Project</h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry too much if some of the following commands seem complex. After you&#8217;ve created a couple of projects, you&#8217;ll know them like the back of your hand.</p>\n<p>First of all, you need to know that Django is an external package. In other words, it doesn&#8217;t come built-in with Python, so you&#8217;ll need to install it with PIP.</p>\n<p>PIP is a package manager for Python, a tool that allows you to install Python packages from the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pypi.org/\">Python Package Index</a> (PyPI).</p>\n<p>Now, before installing the actual Python package, you&#8217;ll need to create a virtual environment. It&#8217;s a good practice to create a virtual environment for each Django project you build, so you can keep track of dependencies.</p>\n<p>Maybe the code you have in a Django 2.6 project may not work with Django 3.0. A virtual environment lets you have specific requirements for each project you have.</p>\n<p>You can create a <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/virtual-environments-python-made-easy/\">virtual environment</a> named <code>.venv</code> (or whatever name you want) with the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">python -m venv .venv\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, if you list the files in the current directory, you&#8217;ll see a new folder called <code>.venv</code>, which at the same time contains isolated Python binaries:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ ls -lah .venv/\r\nPermissions Size User   Date Modified Name\r\ndrwxr-xr-x     - daniel 10 nov 23:13  .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x     - daniel 10 nov 23:13  ..\r\ndrwxr-xr-x     - daniel 10 nov 23:13  bin\r\ndrwxr-xr-x     - daniel 10 nov 23:13  include\r\ndrwxr-xr-x     - daniel 10 nov 23:13  lib\r\nlrwxrwxrwx     3 daniel 10 nov 23:13  lib64 -&gt; lib\r\n.rw-r--r--    69 daniel 10 nov 23:13  pyvenv.cfg\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>To active your virtual environment, you need to activate it with the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">source .venv/bin/activate\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will only work on bash shells (available on macOS and Linux). If you&#8217;re using a different shell, you can take a look at the following activation <code>venv</code> table:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Platform</th>\n<th>Shell</th>\n<th>Command to activate virtual environment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>POSIX</td>\n<td>bash/zsh</td>\n<td>$ source .venv&gt;/bin/activate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>fish</td>\n<td>$ source .venv&gt;/bin/activate.fish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>csh/tcsh</td>\n<td>$ source .venv&gt;/bin/activate.csh</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>PowerShell Core</td>\n<td>$ .venv/bin/Activate.ps1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Windows</td>\n<td>cmd.exe</td>\n<td>C:\\&gt; .venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>PowerShell</td>\n<td>PS C:\\&gt; .venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A way to check that your shell is activated is by looking for changes in your prompt. In my case, what I saw is pictured below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636604523Venv-terminal.jpg\" alt=\"Virtual Environment Prompt\" /></p>\n<p>Now, install the Django package. You can either install the latest or a specific version of Django:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">pip install django # Latest version\r\npip install django==2.2 # Specific version\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/start-django-project-app/?utm_source=rss\">How to Quickly Start a Django Project and a Django App</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

What in the world? Great question, these types of domain stem from <em>Wildcard DNS Records</em> which look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">*.example.               3600     TXT   \"Wild! You have found a wildcard.\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When used, this DNS record will cause any subdomain that matches with the wildcard to hold a <code>TXT</code> value of: “Wild! You have found a wildcard.”</p>\n\n<p>For example, if this was set on the domain <code>smashingmagazine.com</code>, <code>apples.example.smashingmagazine.com</code> and <code>oranges.example.smashingmagazine.com</code> would both return the above TXT value. The same principle can be applied to CNAME &amp; A records as well.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"wild-use-cases-for-wildcards\">Wild Use Cases For Wildcards</h2>\n\n<p>Wildcards can be used for a wide range of things. For now, let’s focus on where they can be applied in combination with Next.js:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Providing Hosted Services</strong><br />\nThe most common use of wildcard domains is to provide users of hosted services their own space with a unique subdomain. For example, if I was building a platform for restaurants to host digital ordering platforms with the domain <code>menus.abc</code>, I would be able to offer Dom’s Pizzeria <code>domspizzeria.menus.abc</code> and Magical Prata the domain <code>magicalprata.menus.abc</code>. The benefit of this is that it gives each of these establishments their enclosed space which they can customize and build out. This space can act as its own website &mdash; not tied to anything.</li>\n<li><strong>Hosting Content And Personal Portfolios</strong><br />\nWildcards can also be used as a space for hosting content in portfolios, giving a sense of individuality to these portfolios, an example of this would be how Medium provides subdomains for the authors.</li>\n<li><strong>Wilder More Creative Use Cases</strong><br />\nYou can’t define these use cases, but there are many creative use cases of these styles of domains. For example, later in this article, we’ll be developing a web toy that flips a webpage upside down making it readable for Australians.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-caveats-of-wildcards-with-next-js\">The Caveats Of Wildcards With Next.js</h2>\n\n<p><em>Sigh.</em> Unfortunately, using wildcards isn’t perfect there are a couple of drawbacks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No More Static-Site Generation (and ISR)</strong><br />\nUnfortunately, there aren’t any special systems to provide custom statically generated pages for different wildcard subdomains like you may with dynamic routing for example (where you have <code>[slug].js</code> files).</li>\n<li><strong>Difficulties with Development</strong><br />\nWhen developing locally, it can be a pain to simulate wildcard domains and we’ll be touching on this a fair bit later on in this article but it is something important to keep in mind.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Deployment Platforms</strong><br />\nVercel supports Wildcard Domains, however, other Jamstack oriented platforms do not all support wildcard domains. For example, Netlify limits the feature to a select group of users on the Pro plan.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"building-with-wildcards\">Building With Wildcards</h2>\n\n<p>With all this talk, let’s look at building with these domains. We’ll be focusing on three places where you can get the wildcard:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#server-side-in-getserversideprops\">Server Side In <code>getServerSideProps</code></a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"#client-side-with-useeffect\">Client Side With <code>useEffect</code></a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"#server-side-on-api-routes-and-edge-functions\"><a href=\"link\">Server Side On API Routes And Edge Functions</a></a>.\n\n<br /></li>\n</ol>\n\n<div data-audience=\"non-subscriber\" data-remove=\"true\" class=\"feature-panel-container\"><span class=\"feature-panel__desc\">More after jump!

As discussed above, this can not be done through static site generation so we must do it on server-side rendered pages.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>getServerSideProps</code> is passed a context object, in this object you can access the HTTP request object using <code>context.req</code>. In this request object, you can access the hostname at <code>headers.host</code>, which will return a string such as <code>example.yourdomain.com</code>. We can split the string into an array across each period and then access the first item in said array. In code, that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  let wildcard = context.req.headers.host.split(\".\")[0];\n  wildcard =\n    wildcard != \"yourdomain\"\n      ? process.env.NODE_ENV != \"development\"\n        ? wildcard\n        : process.env.TEST_WILDCARD\n      : \"home\";\n  return { props: { wildcard } };\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see in this piece of code, we do an extra set processing on the wildcard if it’s the base domain we set the wildcard to <code>home</code> (if taking user input, this is a case you will need to handle) and if we are testing on localhost we can test out other wildcards. In our default export function, which renders our page we can use a switch statement to handle the wildcards:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default function App(props) {\n  switch(props.wildcard) {\n    case \"home\":\n      return &lt;div&gt;Welcome to the home page!&lt;/div&gt;;\n      break;\n    default:\n      return &lt;div&gt;The wild card is: {props.wildcard}.&lt;/div&gt;;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"client-side-with-useeffect\">Client Side With <code>useEffect</code></h3>\n\n<p>If you only want to make small modifications to each page on a different wildcard, you can avoid using server-side rendering by using the <code>useEffect</code> hook on the client-side. This approach will be rather similar to how we did it in <code>getServerSideProps</code>, except we will be relying on <code>window.location.hostname</code>. Using <code>window</code> means that the initial server render won’t be able to access the information, so we must wrap it within a <code>useEffect</code> hook that runs on the client-side. Here’s how that code looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// useEffect and useState must be imported from 'react'\n\nconst [wildcard, setWildcard] = useState(\"\")\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\n    setWildcard(window.location.hostname.split(\".\")[0])\n  }, [])</code></pre>\n\n<p>This approach, however, is far from perfect as there is a delay between the page’s first render and the wildcard being available. Therefore, if you are making drastic changes based on the wildcard then the changes will be jarring for your user. This may also hurt your cumulative layout shift measure on your web vitals. With this in mind, I highly recommend limiting your use of this approach to adaptations that would be off-sight from the viewer on the initial load. An example would be a branded footer, on a technical documentation page. It is, of course, still handy to know.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"server-side-on-api-routes-and-edge-functions\">Server Side On API Routes And Edge Functions</h3>\n\n<p>API routes are another area where you may want to access a wildcard from. Fortunately, the same request object we discussed in the above section on <code>getServerSideProps</code> is also available when using a Node.js API route with Next.js. We can access it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default (req, res) =&gt; {\n  let wildcard = req.headers.host.split(\".\")[0];\n  wildcard =\n    wildcard != \"yourdomain\"\n      ? process.env.NODE_ENV != \"development\"\n        ? wildcard\n        : process.env.TEST_WILDCARD\n      : \"home\";\n  res.json({ wildcard: wildcard })\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>Following this, we can then take certain actions such as fetching different data from your database depending on the wildcard and return that from the API.</p>\n\n<p>This same logic can be applied to Next.js’ new Edge Functions / Middleware. This enables you to use wildcards in more than one route without duplicating code as well as speeding up the processing as code execution happens on the edge. Whilst the functionality is still in beta, it’s certainly something to keep an eye on.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// _middleware.js\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  let wildcard = req.headers.get(\"host\").split(\".\")[0];\n  console.log(wildcard);\n  wildcard =\n    wildcard != \"yourdomain\"\n      ? process.env.NODE_ENV != \"development\"\n        ? wildcard\n        : process.env.TEST_WILDCARD\n      : \"home\";\n  console.log(process.env.TEST_WILDCARD);\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ wildcard: wildcard }), {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n  });\n}</code></pre>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-aussie-izer\">The 🦘Aussie-izer</h2>\n\n<p>Now that we’ve explored the theory of this strategy, let’s explore how we put it into practice. In this section, we’ll be taking this approach to build a project that flips websites upside down (well, websites that are using a .com domain and aren’t subdomains) called the 🦘Aussie-izer.</p>\n\n<p>To get started, we’re going to want to run <code>yarn init</code> and then <code>yarn add next react react-dom</code>, and finish up by adding these standard scripts to our <code>package.json</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">\"scripts\": {\n  \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n  \"build\": \"next build\",\n  \"start\": \"next start\",\n  \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>As soon as we’ve got a standard Next.js project set up, we’re going to want to create the only code file we’ll need for this project: <code>pages/index.js</code>.</p>\n\n<p>First, we’ll want to add the <code>getServerSideProps</code> function in which we’ll extract the wildcard (as I’ll be hosting this at <code>aussieizer.sampoder.com</code>) that’s what I’ll be evaluating to <code>home</code> as:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  let wildcard = context.req.headers.host.split(\".\")[0];\n  wildcard =\n    wildcard != \"aussieizer\"\n      ? wildcard != \"localhost:3000\"\n        ? wildcard\n        : process.env.TEST_WILDCARD\n      : \"home\";\n  return { props: { wildcard } };\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>We’ll then be using that wildcard, to render an iFrame to fill that page (by flipping iFrame over to create the effect), with our <code>src</code> being set to <code>{`https://${props.wildcard}.com`}</code>. We’ll use a switch case, as we discussed above, to render a small helper page if they visit the home page:</p>\n\n<div class=\"break-out\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default function App(props) {\n  switch (props.wildcard) {\n    case \"home\":\n      return (\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          Welcome to the Aussie-izer! This only works for .com domains. If you\n          want to Aussie-ize{\" \"}\n          &lt;a href=\"https://example.com\"&gt;https://example.com&lt;/a&gt; visit{\" \"}\n          &lt;a href=\"https://example.aussieizer.sampoder.com\"&gt;\n            https://example.aussieizer.sampoder.com\n          &lt;/a&gt;.\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      );\n      break;\n    default:\n      return (\n        &lt;iframe\n          src={`https://${props.wildcard}.com`}\n          style={{\n            transform: \"rotate(180deg)\",\n            border: \"none\",\n            height: \"100vh\",\n            width: \"100%\",\n            overflow: \"hidden\",\n          }}\n          frameBorder=\"0\"\n          scrolling=\"yes\"\n          seamless=\"seamless\"\n          height=\"100%\"\n          width=\"100%\"\n        &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n      );\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>And we’re ready to go! The live version is available at <a href=\"https://aussieizer.sampoder.com\">https://aussieizer.sampoder.com</a> and the source code can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/sampoder/aussie-izer/\">https://github.com/sampoder/aussie-izer/</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"hosting-deployment\">Hosting/Deployment</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re hosting on a custom server, wildcard domains will be a breeze to set up through DNS. However, a great part about using Jamstack is being able to host on services such as Vercel or Netlify; these services have their own domain management systems.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vercel\">Vercel</h3>\n\n<p>Vercel supports wildcard domains out of the box &mdash; for all accounts. To use them, first visit the <code>Domains</code> section of your deployment’s <code>Settings</code> tab. Next, you’ll want to enter your domain by using a <code>*</code> to signify the wildcard.</p>\n\n<p>For the above example, I entered:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">*.aussieizer.sampoder.com</code></pre>\n\n<p>You most likely will also want to add your root domain (<code>aussieizer.sampoder.com</code>, in my case) to be able to provide a homepage or some instructions, however, that could also be a separate codebase.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"netlify\">Netlify</h3>\n\n<p>Netlify limits their wildcards feature to Pro accounts; if you have a Pro account, you will need to email their support staff for them to then enable the option on your account. It will show up in the domain settings page once enabled.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"render\">Render</h3>\n\n<p>Render also offers wildcard domains to all users. Simply enter a domain with a <code>*</code> (signifying your wildcard) in the <code>Add Custom Domain</code> input on the custom domains section of your site’s settings page which will enable the wildcard. Please note that Render will require you to add additional records to your DNS so that they can issue a <code>LetsEncrypt</code> SSL certificate (exact instructions will be shown to you when you input your wildcard domain).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"that-s-it\">That’s It!</h2>\n\n<p>Wildcard domains often go under the radar &mdash; I hope you enjoyed exploring them with me. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p><em>Also: FYI Australians do not actually see upside down.</em></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"further-reading-on-smashing-magazine\">Further Reading On Smashing Magazine</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/05/evolution-jamstack/\">The Evolution Of Jamstack</a>,” Mathias Biilmann</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/global-local-styling-nextjs/\">Global vs. Local Styling In Next.js</a>,” Alexander Dubovoy</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/breaking-down-bulky-builds-netlify-nextjs/\">Breaking Down Bulky Builds With Netlify And Next.js</a>,” Atila Fassina</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/smashing-podcast-episode-23/\">What Is Next.js?</a>,” Smashing Podcast episode with Guillermo Rauch</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/11/smashing-podcast-episode-29/\">How Does Netlify Dogfood The Jamstack?</a>,” Smashing Podcast episode with Leslie Cohn-Wein</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"signature\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/logo/logo--red.png\" alt=\"Smashing Editorial\" width=\"35\" height=\"46\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" />\n  <span>(vf, yk, il)</span>\n</div>\n\n\n              </article>\n            </body>\n          </html>\n        "

All you need to do is add your company or product name, product descriptions, and a tone of voice to generate your marketing message.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631589872Jarvis-AI-Marketing-Framework-Templates.jpg\" alt=\"Jarvis AI-powered marketing automation templates\" /></p>\n<p>Below is an example of a marketing copy for a fictional electric car company generated with the PAS framework. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631589849AI-Generated-PAS-Marketing-Copy.jpg\" alt=\"AI-generated PAS marketing copy\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"jarvisfeatures\">Jarvis features</h3>\n<p>For those marketers handling ecommerce stores, this tool can also generate product descriptions, a bullet point list of features, and SEO product page title and meta descriptions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631589845AI-Ecommerce-Product-Descriptions.jpg\" alt=\"Jarvis e-commerce product description templates\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes to <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/automated-email-marketing-getting-started/\">email marketing automation</a>, many marketers use email service providers (ESPs) like ConvertKit and MailChimp to send a series of automated emails to potential customers. With Jarvis, you can basically generate the content that goes inside those emails without needing any copywriting knowledge.</p>\n<p>This AI software can also help automate part of your content marketing strategy, which is the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/190858/most-effective-online-marketing-channels-according-to-us-companies/\">most effective</a> digital marketing technique according to a survey done by Statista.</p>\n<p>For example, you can use Jarvis’ long-form editor and give it commands like “write blog post titles about the best HTML and CSS books” or “write an intro paragraph for an article about learning HTML and CSS,” and it will generate those for you.</p>\n<p>For a more in-depth guide on how to write long-form blog posts with AI, you can explore this <a href=\"https://blogstalgia.com/write-blog-posts-with-jarvis/\">Jarvis tutorial</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631589867Jarvis-AI-Long-Form-Editor.png\" alt=\"Jarvis long-form editor commands\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"jarvisrecipes\">Jarvis recipes</h3>\n<p>Jarvis has a set of pre-made workflows called &#8220;Recipes&#8221; that contain multiple commands to help you speed up your content creation process.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631589877Jarvis-AI-Recipes-Example.jpg\" alt=\"Recipe for writing a blog post\" /></p>\n<p>For example, you can run recipes for <a href=\"https://community.jarvis.ai/recipes/321f6174-b233-47cd-8a21-29aee00e016f\">writing blog posts</a>, <a href=\"https://community.jarvis.ai/recipes/b131075f-6d57-48c0-84c8-c46a9cc9aa78\">rewriting content</a>, and <a href=\"https://community.jarvis.ai/recipes/d00b62b9-a529-4285-ac9a-a291998c7866\">crafting outreach emails</a> by just following the commands.</p>\n<p>For those doing Pinterest and social media marketing, you can create descriptions for your <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-a-brand-on-instagram-with-these-25-tips/\">Instagram posts</a>, Facebook posts, and Pinterest Pins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2surfer\">2. Surfer</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that SEO is an integral part of digital marketing. It has the power to <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/increase-web-traffic-using-automation/\">increase your website traffic</a>, conversion rates, and <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/creating-a-brand-identity-20-questions/\">brand awareness</a>.</p>\n<p>An artificial intelligence tool like <a href=\"https://surferseo.com/\">Surfer</a> allows you to perform more accurate SEO analysis by using natural language processing (NLP).</p>\n<p>Since introducing the <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html\">BERT</a> algorithm update, Google has been focusing more on recognizing user intent and the context in which a keyword is being used instead of simply looking at each individual keyword.</p>\n<p>Surfer added this to their platform via the Google NLP API. So you can easily check which words, phrases, and sentiment Google believes to be important. </p>\n<p>With this AI software platform, you can plan content based on keywords or your domain. </p>\n<h3 id=\"contentplanningbasedonkeywords\">Content Planning Based on Keywords</h3>\n<p>When adding your main keyword or blog niche, Surfer will generate several topic clusters using Google data and Surfer&#8217;s NLP algorithm. Below is an example of some topic clusters generated for the keyword “vanilla javascript”.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631589908Vanilla-JavaScript-AI-Generated-Topic-Clusters.jpg\" alt=\"Content planner using keywords\" /></p>\n<p>Each topic cluster will include a few relevant target keywords along with their search volume and projected total traffic. These boxes can then be used to create new blog posts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contentplanningbasedondomain\">Content Planning Based on Domain</h3>\n<p>When it comes to planning content using your domain, Surfer shows you a list of keywords that you rank for but aren’t using inside your articles, as well as your ranking position for each of them, the traffic they bring, and the monthly search volume.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631589885Planning-Content-Based-on-Domain-With-Surfer-SEO.jpg\" alt=\"Content planner using domain\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"surfercontenteditor\">Surfer Content Editor</h3>\n<p>One of Surfer&#8217;s main features is its content editor, which includes live updates on how your content is doing in terms of SEO. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631589904Surfer-SEO-Content-Editor-With-NLP.jpg\" alt=\"Surfer SEO content editor\" /></p>\n<p>Inside the content editor, you&#8217;ll be able to see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NLP phrases to include and how often to use them</li>\n<li>how long your blog post should be</li>\n<li>how many headings, images, and paragraphs you should use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you decide to use an AI tool like Jarvis, the two also integrate, so you can see your content score inside Jarvis&#8217; long-form editor instead of having to paste your article back inside Surfer.</p>\n<p>For organizations with large marketing teams, you have a document-sharing feature that makes collaboration easier.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/marketing-automation-ai-tools-boost-growth/?utm_source=rss\">Marketing Automation: The Best AI Tools for Boosting Growth</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

No wonder most people experience email fatigue, which makes it harder for marketers to build customer loyalty and increase sales via email. Although the rivalry is fierce, email is still one of the most effective marketing channels. For example, in the first half of 2021, conversions for ecommerce automated emails <a href=\"https://www.omnisend.com/resources/reports/email-sms-push-marketing-statistics-h1-2021/\">increased to 33.19%</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>To create an email worth your subscribers’ attention, make sure that it either <strong>offers quality benefits or entertains the subscribers</strong>. Sounds easy, right? In practice, you’ll probably have to fine-tune your newsletter a dozen times to make it follow these two simple rules. </p>\n<p>In this article, I’m going to make your <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/automated-email-marketing-getting-started/\">email marketing journey</a> a little less bumpy by sharing practical advice and illustrating it with examples. This article will be helpful for both newbies and experienced email specialists who are looking for inspiration.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll start by looking at the elements of an email, showing both good and bad examples.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thesubjectline\">The Subject Line</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the all-important subject line in emails. The rule of thumb here is that <strong>the first impression is the last impression</strong>.</p>\n<p>I won’t be able to teach you here any spells that will hypnotize readers and make them open your newsletter. But <em>can</em> show you good strategies that are likely to improve your subject lines and increase your email open rate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tipsandgoodexamplesofappealingsubjectlines\">Tips and good examples of appealing subject lines</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep your subject lines succinct</strong>. Remember that most mobile device users won’t see the whole subject if it’s longer than 25–30 characters. Also, a short and catchy subject line is more likely to capture users’ attention without reminding them of a teaser ad.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Personalize your subject lines</strong>. It’s a good idea to add a subscriber’s name to the subject line or congratulate them on a happy event (be it their birthday or the first purchase on your website).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use your imagination to engage subscribers</strong>. I love using creative techniques in subject lines. They&#8217;re not just fun, but also effective. You can make an allusion to a popular TV series, refer to a recent event, or create suspense to intrigue your subscribers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636325879subject-line.jpg\" alt=\"Subject line: Want to know what's keeping me up at night?\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Offer benefits</strong>. If creative strategies puzzle you, don’t worry: you still can make your subject line catchy by offering something beneficial.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"cringestrategiesyoudbetterneveruseinyouremails\">Cringe strategies you’d better never use in your emails</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Avoid caps lock and don’t use a dozen exclamation marks in one subject line</strong>. Subjects that offer “90% LAST CHANCE SALES ONLY TODAY!!!!” not only make subscribers feel uncomfortable but are also likely to end up in the spam folder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Emojis aren&#8217;t a magic pill that guarantees your emails will be opened</strong>. In fact, it’s quite the opposite: in some cases, they might harm user experience by making a subject line look impersonal and annoying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Yes, I know I’ve recommended personalizing your subject lines, but <strong>don’t take personalization too far</strong>. Perhaps the “don’t overdo it” rule works for all marketing strategies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last thought: you can’t rely on a single metric (like open rate) to estimate the success of email campaigns, and the recent updates on <a href=\"https://emailsoldiers.com/blog/apple-mail-privacy-protection\">Apple Mail Privacy Protection</a> have demonstrated this clearly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"imagesinemails\">Images in Emails</h2>\n<p>The golden rule when using images in emails is <strong>keep the quality of visual information</strong>.</p>\n<p>Did you know that about <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33423/19-Reasons-You-Should-Include-Visual-Content-in-Your-Marketing-Data.aspx\">40% of people</a> perceive visual information better than plain text? That’s why maintaining the quality of your visual email content is a must. Let’s briefly discuss the basic rules and then dive into common issues connected with images in emails.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rulesofuserfriendlyimagesinemails\">Rules of user-friendly images in emails</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Keep the size of images in your emails small (not larger than 500 Kb, but preferably much lower). Otherwise, some of the users might fail to see the images because they’re loading too slowly. Use services like TinyPNG or iLoveIMG to compress your images.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remember to adjust the size of your email banner to the width of the template for better user experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consider image accessibility: make the text placed over images easy to read, and don’t forget to add alternative text (we’ll touch upon it later).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"howtoreducethechancethatyourimagegetsblocked\">How to reduce the chance that your image gets blocked</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Take care of your email domain reputation, as some email clients (such as Outlook) block images sent by “suspicious” addresses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I’ll repeat myself: you don&#8217;t need high-quality pictures. Always compress your images to ensure your emails won’t get trimmed or blocked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Test your emails before sending them to the whole email list. You can use EmailOnAcid or Litmus to check them faster. However, some businesses may need specialists to perform tests on real devices.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"whatifyourimagesstillgetblockedbysomeemailclients\">What if your images still get blocked by some email clients?</h3>\n<p>Sometimes your images may still get blocked regardless of your efforts (or they can simply fail to be displayed because of a poor connection). You need to be prepared for images not loading. Here are some tips to follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t send the whole email in one or several pictures with no text.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write ALT-text (alternative text) that describes the images. It’s not only about you playing safe, but also about your email being disability-friendly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add a link to a web version of your email in case the images won’t display for some reason.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"emailcopy\">Email Copy</h2>\n<p>The goal with your email content is to achieve <strong>unity of form and content</strong>. Let&#8217;s look at what that means.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howyoushouldalignyouremailcopy\">How you should align your email copy</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Never justify your email copy. Although some people find justified text more pleasant to look at, justification <a href=\"http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb38-2/tb119veytsman-justify.pdf\">decreases reading speed</a>. Also, justified text isn&#8217;t dyslexia-friendly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can right-align your contact details in the header or footer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can center the lines you want to emphasize.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I recommend using flush left alignment in all the other cases. Studies prove that left-aligned text is <a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED337749\">easier to read and remember</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"toneofvoice\">Tone of voice</h3>\n<p>Your content&#8217;s tone of voice should be an integral part of your brand identity. If your style is generally light and friendly, you may confuse your subscribers by suddenly going all official. And vice versa: if you’ve chosen a formal communication style for your website, you shouldn’t switch to sending memes.</p>\n<p>Note that the same style has different performances for various businesses. Sometimes you have to study your audience before you understand what communication strategy will build customer loyalty in your case.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/create-emails-that-foster-customer-loyalty/?utm_source=rss\">How to Create Emails that Foster Customer Loyalty</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

They often consist of graphical user interfaces that write application code automatically behind the scenes.</strong> </p>\n<p>Over the past couple of years, no-code development has taken the IT industry by storm. According to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-10-gartner-says-the-majority-of-technology-products-and-services-will-be-built-by-professionals-outside-of-it-by-2024\">Gartner</a>, 80% of technology products and services will be built outside of IT by 2024. According to a recent <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/20/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-no-code-low-code-landscape/\">Tonkean survey</a>, 96% of 500 US-based IT and operations professionals have reported that they have already adopted or will soon to adopt no-code/low-code tools.</p>\n<p>While the concept of empowering business users to build their own applications has been around for a long time, this new wave of products — powered by a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/\">significant infusion of private capital</a> and <a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2020/10/06/low-code-no-code-tools-may-finally-usher-era-citizen-developers/\">wider adoption of cloud computing</a> — is becoming a viable alternative to traditional application development. Larger enterprises could significantly benefit from this trend.</p>\n<p>Business users in large enterprises have been building and maintaining their own applications for decades. To this end, many business users choose <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/office-excel-why-its-microsofts-not-so-secret-weapon-in-no-code-app-development/\">spreadsheets as their main platform</a> — in particular, <a href=\"https://www.notboring.co/p/excel-never-dies-audio\">Microsoft Excel</a>. Those familiar with VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) are also able to implement more advanced capabilities in Excel and create integrations with other software like Microsoft Access for data persistence. But this type of no-code usage has always suffered from the inherent limitations of a file-based approach.</p>\n<p>The new generation of no-code technologies offers a unique opportunity to build applications that are often indistinguishable by the end user from those that are built by professional developers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hugenocodeopportunitiesforenterprise\">Huge No-code Opportunities for Enterprise</h2>\n<p>No-code platforms can present huge opportunities for enterprises in the application development space.</p>\n<p>Application development is expensive and time consuming. This is especially true in large enterprises — and for good reason: rushing the release of a buggy application can be very costly to an enterprise. Thus, they have tedious internal processes around the development, testing, and release of applications, ensuring that they&#8217;re secure, stable, and scalable. This makes the application development lifecycle a time-consuming and costly process. The development cost of an average enterprise-level web application is typically in <a href=\"https://www.comentum.com/web-development-cost-rate-comparison.html\">$100k to $1m</a> range. <a href=\"https://www.formotus.com/blog/figuring-the-costs-of-custom-mobile-business-app-development\">According to a 2016 survey by Enterprise Mobility Exchange</a>, 29% of respondents budgeted $250-500k and 25% budgeted over $1.5m for an average mobile application development project.</p>\n<p>While this is understandable for business-critical, external-facing applications, there are many other application development needs that are less critical and intended for internal usage only. Yet, these are often subjected to the same level of scrutiny. Why should an application that will only be utilized by a handful of internal users take so long and cost so much to develop?</p>\n<p>Often, <a href=\"https://www.itbusinessedge.com/business-intelligence/low-code-apps-based-on-spreadsheets-simplify-digital-business-transformation/\">business units have already built their target applications in Excel</a>, but these are not as efficient as web applications. Most enterprise CIOs and IT managers have heard these arguments so many times. Yet, they have had no sanctioned solution aside from building traditional applications. The new generation of no-code platforms can change this. Offering business units an alternative platform, where they can build web applications with minimal dependence on IT departments, can be an invaluable boon to large enterprises.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/no-code-enterprise-opportunities-challenges/?utm_source=rss\">No-code for Enterprise: Opportunities and Challenges</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Today, we’ll take a look at the best ways to use colors in a design system, and what we can expect from our colors in the not-too-distant future.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"well-known-color-values\">Well-Known Color Values</h2>\n\n<p>There are many different ways to define colors in CSS. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/named-colors-and-hex-equivalents/\">CSS named colors</a> are one of the simplest ways to color an element:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These are very limited, and rarely fit the designs we are building! We could also use color hex (hexadecimal) values. This code gives our element a red background color:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background-color: #ff0000;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unless you’re a color expert, hex values are very difficult to read. It’s unlikely you would be able to guess the color of an element by reading the hex value. When building a website we might be given a hex color value by a designer, but if they asked us to make it, say 20% darker, we would have a hard time doing that by adjusting the hex value, without a visual guide or color picker.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rgb\">RGB</h3>\n\n<p>RGB (red, green, blue) notation is an alternative way of writing colors, giving us access to the same range of colors as hex values, in a much more readable form. We have an <code>rgb()</code> function in CSS for this. Colors on the web are additive, meaning the higher the proportion of red, green and blue, the lighter the resulting color will be. If we only use the red channel, the result is red:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Setting the red, green and blue channels to the highest value will result in white:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can also add an alpha channel (for transparency), by using the <code>rgba()</code> function:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); // transparency of 50%\n}\n\n.my-element {\n  background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1); // fully opaque\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>rgb()</code> and <code>rgba()</code> allow us to “mix” colors in our code to some extent, but the results can be somewhat unpredictable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hsl\">HSL</h3>\n\n<p>More recently, we have been able to use HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) values, with the <code>hsl()</code> and <code>hsla()</code> color functions. As a developer, these are far more intuitive when it comes to adjusting color values. For example, we can get darker and lighter variants of the same color by adjusting the <code>lightness</code> parameter:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background-color: hsl(0deg, 100%, 20%); // dark red\n}\n\n.my-element {\n  background-color: hsl(0deg, 100%, 50%); // medium red\n}\n\n.my-element {\n  background-color: hsl(0deg, 100%, 80%); // light red\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"\n  \n    break-out article__image\n  \n  \n  \">\n  \n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a6d3545f-7d8b-497a-99be-6f4bb8704b64/1-modern-css-color.png\">\n    \n    <img\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      decoding=\"async\"\n      importance=\"low\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"800\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsrcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a6d3545f-7d8b-497a-99be-6f4bb8704b64/1-modern-css-color.png 400w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a6d3545f-7d8b-497a-99be-6f4bb8704b64/1-modern-css-color.png 800w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a6d3545f-7d8b-497a-99be-6f4bb8704b64/1-modern-css-color.png 1200w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a6d3545f-7d8b-497a-99be-6f4bb8704b64/1-modern-css-color.png 1600w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a6d3545f-7d8b-497a-99be-6f4bb8704b64/1-modern-css-color.png 2000w\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a6d3545f-7d8b-497a-99be-6f4bb8704b64/1-modern-css-color.png\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsizes=\"100vw\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Three color swatches resulting from the previous code, ranging from dark to light red\"\n\t\t/>\n    \n    </a>\n  \n\n  \n    <figcaption class=\"op-vertical-bottom\">\n      (<a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a6d3545f-7d8b-497a-99be-6f4bb8704b64/1-modern-css-color.png'>Large preview</a>)\n    </figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n\n<p>The <code>hue</code> parameter represents the position on a color wheel, and can be any value between <code>0</code> and <code>360deg</code>.

It effectively allows us to use the current text color of an element as a variable. It’s pretty limited when compared with custom properties, but it’s often used for setting the fill color of SVG icons, to ensure they match the text color of their parent. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/cascading-svg-fill-color/\">Read about it here</a>.</p>\n\n<div data-audience=\"non-subscriber\" data-remove=\"true\" class=\"feature-panel-container\"><span class=\"feature-panel__desc\">More after jump!

We no longer need the values to be comma-separated, and the <code>rgb()</code> and <code>hsl()</code> functions can take an optional alpha parameter, separated with a forward slash:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  /* optional alpha value gives us 50% opacity */\n  background-color: hsl(0 100% 50% / 0.5);\n}\n\n.my-element {\n  /* With no alpha value the background is fully opaque*/\n  background-color: hsl(0 100% 50%);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-css-color-functions\">New CSS Color Functions</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"hwb\">HWB</h3>\n\n<p>HWB stands for hue, whiteness and blackness. Like HSL, the hue can be anywhere within a range of 0 to 360. The other two arguments control how much white or black is mixed into that hue, up to 100% (which would result in a totally white or totally black color). If equal amounts of white and black are mixed in, the color becomes increasingly gray. We can think of this as being similar to mixing paint. It could be especially useful for creating monochrome color palettes</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"\n  \n    break-out article__image\n  \n  \n  \">\n  \n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/536ab898-2bb4-4c42-a9f1-e46bf1da7f63/2-modern-css-color.png\">\n    \n    <img\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      decoding=\"async\"\n      importance=\"low\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"800\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsrcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/536ab898-2bb4-4c42-a9f1-e46bf1da7f63/2-modern-css-color.png 400w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/536ab898-2bb4-4c42-a9f1-e46bf1da7f63/2-modern-css-color.png 800w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/536ab898-2bb4-4c42-a9f1-e46bf1da7f63/2-modern-css-color.png 1200w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/536ab898-2bb4-4c42-a9f1-e46bf1da7f63/2-modern-css-color.png 1600w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/536ab898-2bb4-4c42-a9f1-e46bf1da7f63/2-modern-css-color.png 2000w\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/536ab898-2bb4-4c42-a9f1-e46bf1da7f63/2-modern-css-color.png\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsizes=\"100vw\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Five color swatches resulting from HWB colors with different amounts of white/black\"\n\t\t/>\n    \n    </a>\n  \n\n  \n    <figcaption class=\"op-vertical-bottom\">\n      (<a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/536ab898-2bb4-4c42-a9f1-e46bf1da7f63/2-modern-css-color.png'>Large preview</a>)\n    </figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n\n<p>Try it out with <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/xxLmOgV\">this demo</a> (works in Safari only):</p>\n\n<figure class=\"break-out\">\n\t<p data-height=\"500\"\n\tdata-theme-id=\"light\"\n\tdata-slug-hash=\"xxLmOgV\"\n\tdata-user=\"smashingmag\"\n\tdata-default-tab=\"result\"\n\tclass=\"codepen\">See the Pen [HWB color (Safari only)](https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/xxLmOgV) by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker\">Michelle Barker</a>.</p>\n\t<figcaption>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/xxLmOgV\">HWB color (Safari only)</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker\">Michelle Barker</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"lab\">LAB</h3>\n\n<p>LAB and LCH are defined in the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#specifying-lab-lch\">specification</a> as <strong>device-independent colors</strong>. LAB is a color space that can be accessed in software like Photoshop and is recommended if you want a color to look the same on-screen as, say, printed on a t-shirt. It uses three axes: lightness, followed by the <em>a-axis</em> (green to red) and <em>b-axis</em> (blue to yellow).</p>\n\n<p>Lightness is expressed as a percentage, much like HSL, but can in fact exceed 100% when used with the <code>lab()</code> color function. Extra-bright whites can use a percentage of up to 400%. Values for the <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> axes can range from positive to negative. Two negative values will result in a color towards the green/blue end of the spectrum, while two positive values can give a more orange/red hue.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background-color: lab(80% 100 50); // reddish pink\n}\n\n.my-element {\n  background-color: lab(80% -80 -100); // blue/turquoise\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"\n  \n    break-out article__image\n  \n  \n  \">\n  \n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da33544f-aab5-4fc3-81d9-d3e5f75442d4/3-modern-css-color.png\">\n    \n    <img\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      decoding=\"async\"\n      importance=\"low\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"800\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsrcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da33544f-aab5-4fc3-81d9-d3e5f75442d4/3-modern-css-color.png 400w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da33544f-aab5-4fc3-81d9-d3e5f75442d4/3-modern-css-color.png 800w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da33544f-aab5-4fc3-81d9-d3e5f75442d4/3-modern-css-color.png 1200w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da33544f-aab5-4fc3-81d9-d3e5f75442d4/3-modern-css-color.png 1600w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da33544f-aab5-4fc3-81d9-d3e5f75442d4/3-modern-css-color.png 2000w\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da33544f-aab5-4fc3-81d9-d3e5f75442d4/3-modern-css-color.png\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsizes=\"100vw\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Red/pink color swatch with positive a/b values, blue/turquoise color swatch with negative a/b values\"\n\t\t/>\n    \n    </a>\n  \n\n  \n    <figcaption class=\"op-vertical-bottom\">\n      (<a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da33544f-aab5-4fc3-81d9-d3e5f75442d4/3-modern-css-color.png'>Large preview</a>)\n    </figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"break-out\">\n\t<p data-height=\"500\"\n\tdata-theme-id=\"light\"\n\tdata-slug-hash=\"JjywKNK\"\n\tdata-user=\"smashingmag\"\n\tdata-default-tab=\"result\"\n\tclass=\"codepen\">See the Pen [LAB Color (Safari only)](https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/JjywKNK) by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker\">Michelle Barker</a>.</p>\n\t<figcaption>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/JjywKNK\">LAB Color (Safari only)</a> by <a href=\"https://codepen.io/michellebarker\">Michelle Barker</a>.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"lch\">LCH</h3>\n\n<p>LCH stands for lightness, chroma, and hue. As with LAB, <em>lightness</em> can be a percentage that exceeds 100%. Similar to HSL, <em>hue</em> can be a range between 0 and 360. Chroma represents the <em>amount</em> of color, and we can think of it as being similar to saturation in HSL. But chroma can exceed 100 — in fact, it’s theoretically unbounded. Example usage:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background-color: lch(80% 100 50);\n}\n\n.my-element {\n  background-color: lch(80% 240 50); // this color would be outside of the displayable range of today’s browsers\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, there is a limit on how many colors browsers and monitors today can display (more on that shortly), so values above 230 are unlikely to make a difference — the Chroma is reduced until it is within range.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"\n  \n    break-out article__image\n  \n  \n  \">\n  \n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/71cf899c-c146-484e-bb1a-5a26e9e7c55d/4-modern-css-color.png\">\n    \n    <img\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      decoding=\"async\"\n      importance=\"low\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"800\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsrcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/71cf899c-c146-484e-bb1a-5a26e9e7c55d/4-modern-css-color.png 400w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/71cf899c-c146-484e-bb1a-5a26e9e7c55d/4-modern-css-color.png 800w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/71cf899c-c146-484e-bb1a-5a26e9e7c55d/4-modern-css-color.png 1200w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/71cf899c-c146-484e-bb1a-5a26e9e7c55d/4-modern-css-color.png 1600w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/71cf899c-c146-484e-bb1a-5a26e9e7c55d/4-modern-css-color.png 2000w\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/71cf899c-c146-484e-bb1a-5a26e9e7c55d/4-modern-css-color.png\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsizes=\"100vw\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Four LCH color swatches with red hue, varying chroma levels\"\n\t\t/>\n    \n    </a>\n  \n\n  \n    <figcaption class=\"op-vertical-bottom\">\n      The final color on the right is outside the displayable range (gamut), so no difference is perceived.

One reason is that using LAB or LCH, gives us access to a much larger range of colors. LCH and LAB are designed to give us access to the entire spectrum of human vision. Furthermore, HSL and RGB have a few shortcomings: they are not perceptually uniform and, in HSL, increasing or decreasing the lightness has quite a different effect depending on the hue.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/yLoGJXd\">this demo</a>, we can see a stark contrast between LCH and HSL by hitting the grayscale toggle. For the HSL hue and saturation strips, there are clear differences in the perceptual lightness of each square, even though the “lightness” component of the HSL function is the same! Meanwhile, the chroma and hue strips on the LCH side have an almost-uniform perceptual lightness.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"\n  \n    break-out article__image\n  \n  \n  \">\n  \n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4253d9b2-46d7-4b10-9e1a-b5f3ac6cea1c/5-modern-css-color.png\">\n    \n    <img\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      decoding=\"async\"\n      importance=\"low\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"800\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsrcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4253d9b2-46d7-4b10-9e1a-b5f3ac6cea1c/5-modern-css-color.png 400w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4253d9b2-46d7-4b10-9e1a-b5f3ac6cea1c/5-modern-css-color.png 800w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4253d9b2-46d7-4b10-9e1a-b5f3ac6cea1c/5-modern-css-color.png 1200w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4253d9b2-46d7-4b10-9e1a-b5f3ac6cea1c/5-modern-css-color.png 1600w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4253d9b2-46d7-4b10-9e1a-b5f3ac6cea1c/5-modern-css-color.png 2000w\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4253d9b2-46d7-4b10-9e1a-b5f3ac6cea1c/5-modern-css-color.png\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsizes=\"100vw\"\n\t\t\talt=\"LCH and HSL color swatches compared side-by-side\"\n\t\t/>\n    \n    </a>\n  \n\n  \n    <figcaption class=\"op-vertical-bottom\">\n      By applying a grayscale filter we can see that the LCH colors (left) have an almost-uniform lightness when we adjust the chroma and hue, compared to when we adjust the hue and saturation of the HSL colors (right), where there are visible differences in lightness.

In her article, <a href=\"https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/\">LCH color in CSS: what, why, and how?</a>, Lea Verou explains in detail the advantages of LCH color. She also built this <a href=\"https://css.land/lch/\">LCH color picker</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As with other color functions, <code>hwb()</code>, <code>lab()</code> and <code>lch()</code> can also take an optional alpha parameter.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background-color: lch(80% 240 50 / 0.5); // Resulting color has 50% opacity\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"browser-support-and-color-spaces\">Browser Support And Color Spaces</h2>\n\n<p><code>hwb()</code>, <code>lab()</code> and <code>lch()</code> are currently only supported in Safari. It’s possible to start using them straight away by providing a fallback for non-supporting browsers. Browsers that don’t support the color function will simple ignore the second rule:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background-color: lch(55% 102 360);\n\n  /* LCH color converted to RGB using Lea Verou’s tool: https://css.land/lch/ */\n  background-color: rgb(98.38% 0% 53.33%);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If other styles depend on newer color functions being supported, we could use a feature query:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  display: none;\n}\n\n/* Only display this element if the browser supports lch() */\n@supports (background-color: lch(55% 102 360)) {\n  .my-element {\n    display: block;\n    background-color: lch(55% 102 360);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It’s worth noting, as Lea explains in her article, that although modern screens are capable of displaying colors beyond RGB, most browsers currently only support colors within the sRGB color space. In the <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/KKvbMXY\">LAB color demo</a> you might notice that moving the sliders beyond a certain point doesn’t actually affect the color, even in Safari where <code>lab()</code> and <code>lch()</code> are supported. Using values outside of the sRGB range will only have an effect when hardware and browsers advance sufficiently.</p>\n\n<p>Safari now supports the <code>color()</code> function, which enables us to display colors in the P3 space, but these are limited to RGB colors for now, and don’t yet give us all the advantages of LAB and LCH.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  background: rgb(98.38% 0% 53.33%); // bright pink\n  background: color(display-p3 0.947 0 0.5295); // equivalent in P3 color space\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong>: <em>“<a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/10042/wide-gamut-color-in-css-with-display-p3/\">Wide Gamut Color in CSS with Display-P3</a>” by Nikita Vasilyev</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"accessibility\">Accessibility</h2>\n\n<p>Once they are widely supported, perhaps LAB and LCH can help us choose more accessible color combinations. Foreground text should have the same contrast ratio with background colors with different hue or chroma values, as long as their lightness value remains the same. That’s certainly not the case at the moment with HSL colors.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"color-management\">Color Management</h2>\n\n<p>A wider range of color functions means we have more options when it comes to managing colors in our application. Often we require several variants of a given color in our design system, ranging from dark to light.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-properties\">Custom Properties</h3>\n\n<p>CSS custom properties allow us to store values for reuse in our stylesheets. As they allow partial property values, they can be especially useful for managing and manipulating color values. HSL lends itself particularly well to custom properties, due to its intuitiveness. In the previous demo, I’m using them to adjust the hue for each segment of the color strip by calculating a <code>--hue</code> value based on the element’s index (defined in another custom property).</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">li {\n  --hue: calc(var(--i) * (360 / 10));\n  background: hsl(var(--hue, 0) 50% 45%);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can also do things like calculate complementary colors (colors from opposite sides of the color wheel). Plenty has been written about this, so I won’t cover old ground here, but if you’re curious then Sara Soueidan’s article on <a href=\"https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/hex-rgb-to-hsl/\">color management with HSL</a> is a great place to start.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"migrating-from-hex-rgb-to-hsl\">Migrating From Hex/RGB To HSL</h3>\n\n<p>RGB colors might serve your needs up to a point, but if you need the flexibility to be able to derive new shades from your base color palette then you might be better off switching to HSL (or LCH, once supported). I would recommend embracing custom properties for this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>There are plenty of online resources for converting hex or RGB values to HSL (here’s <a href=\"https://www.w3docs.com/tools/color-rgb\">one example</a>).</em></p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you have colors stored as Sass variables:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">$primary: rgb(141 66 245);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When converting to HSL, we can assign custom properties for the hue, saturation and lightness values. This makes it easy to create darker or lighter, more or less saturated variants of the original color.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">:root {\n  --h: 265;\n  --s: 70%;\n  --l: 50%;\n        \n  --primary: hsl(var(--h) var(--s) var(--l));\n  --primaryDark: hsl(var(--h) var(--s) 35%);\n  --primaryLight: hsl(var(--h) var(--s) 75%);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>HSL can be incredibly useful for creating color schemes, as detailed in the article  <a href=\"https://web.dev/building-a-color-scheme/\">Building a Color Scheme</a> by Adam Argyle. In the article he creates light, dark and dim color schemes, using a brand color as a base. I like this approach because it allows for some fine-grained control over the color variant (for example, decreasing the saturation for colors in the “dark” scheme), but still retains the big advantage of custom properties: updating the brand color in just one place will be carried through to all the color schemes, so it could potentially save us a lot of work in the future.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sass-color-functions\">Sass Color Functions</h3>\n\n<p>When it comes to mixing and adjusting colors, Sass has provided <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color\">color functions</a> to enable us to do just this for many years. We can saturate or desaturate, lighten or darken, even mix two colors together. These work great in some cases, but they have some limitations: firstly, we can only use them at compile-time, not for manipulating colors live in the browser. Secondly, they are limited to RGB and HSL, so they suffer from the same issues of perceptual uniformity, as we can see in <a href=\"https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/abyPZVZ\">this demo</a>, where a color is increasingly desaturated yet appears increasingly lighter when converted to grayscale.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"\n  \n    break-out article__image\n  \n  \n  \">\n  \n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad752292-91a6-4289-b31b-784776b86a06/7-modern-css-color.png\">\n    \n    <img\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      decoding=\"async\"\n      importance=\"low\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"800\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsrcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad752292-91a6-4289-b31b-784776b86a06/7-modern-css-color.png 400w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad752292-91a6-4289-b31b-784776b86a06/7-modern-css-color.png 800w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad752292-91a6-4289-b31b-784776b86a06/7-modern-css-color.png 1200w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad752292-91a6-4289-b31b-784776b86a06/7-modern-css-color.png 1600w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad752292-91a6-4289-b31b-784776b86a06/7-modern-css-color.png 2000w\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad752292-91a6-4289-b31b-784776b86a06/7-modern-css-color.png\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsizes=\"100vw\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Red color swatches increasingly desaturated, with grayscale filter applied to top half\"\n\t\t/>\n    \n    </a>\n  \n\n  \n    <figcaption class=\"op-vertical-bottom\">\n      The top strip has a grayscale filter applied.

That’s all about to change: the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-5/#color-mix\">Level 5 CSS Color Specification</a> (working draft) contains proposals for color mixing functions that sound rather promising. The first is the <code>color-mix()</code> function, which mixes two colors much like Sass’s <code>mix()</code> function. But <code>color-mix()</code> in CSS allows us to specify a color space, and uses the LCH by default, with superior mixing as a result.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: <em><code>color-mix()</code> and <code>color-contrast()</code> are now available behind a flag in Safari 15! Check out <a href=\"https://appademic.tech/safari-hidden-features-debug-menu/\">this article</a> on how to enable experimental features in Safari.</em></p>\n\n<p>The colors don’t have to be LCH when passed in as arguments either, but the interpolation will use the specified color space. We can specify how much of each color to mix, similar to gradient stops:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  /* equal amounts of red and blue */\n  background-color: color-mix(in lch, red, blue);\n}\n\n.my-element {\n  /* 30% red, 70% blue */\n  background-color: color-mix(in lch, red 30%, blue);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"color-contrast-and-accessibility\">Color Contrast And Accessibility</h3>\n\n<p><code>color-contrast()</code> is another proposed function, which really does have huge implications for picking accessible colors. In fact, it’s designed with accessibility in mind first and foremost. It permits the browser to pick the most appropriate value from a list, by comparing it with another color. We can even specify the desired contrast ratio to ensure our color schemes meet WCAG guidelines. Colors are evaluated from left to right, and the browser picks the first color from the list that meets the desired ratio. If no colors meet the ratio, the chosen color will be the one with the highest contrast.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.my-element {\n  color: wheat;\n  background-color: color-contrast(wheat vs bisque, darkgoldenrod, olive, sienna, darkgreen, maroon to AA);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Because this isn’t supported in any browsers right now, I’ve borrowed this example directly from the spec. when the browser evaluates the expression the resulting color will be <code>darkgreen</code>, as it is the first one that meets the AA contrast ratio when compared to <code>wheat</code>, the color of the text.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"browser-support\">Browser Support</h3>\n\n<p>The Level 5 Color Specification is currently in Working Draft, meaning no browsers yet support the <code>color-contrast()</code> and <code>color-mix()</code> functions and their syntax is subject to change. But it certainly looks like a bright future for color on the web!</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"environmental-impact-of-colors\">Environmental Impact Of Colors</h2>\n\n<p>Did you know that your chosen color palette can have an impact on how much energy your website uses? On OLED screens (which account for most modern TVs and laptops), darker colors will use significantly less energy than light colors &mdash; with white using the most energy, and black the least. According to Tom Greenwood, author of <a href=\"https://abookapart.com/products/sustainable-web-design\">Sustainable Web Design</a>, blue is also more energy-intensive than colors in the red and green areas of the spectrum. To reduce the environmental impact of your applications, consider a darker color scheme, using less blue, or enabling a dark-mode option for your users. As an added bonus, a more environmentally friendly choice of colors can also reduce the impact on the battery life of mobile devices.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tools\">Tools</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://codepen.io/robdimarzo/full/xxZgKOR\">Hexplorer</a>, Rob DiMarzo<br />\n<em>Learn to understand hex colors with this interactive visualization.</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://css.land/lch/\">LCH color picker</a>, Lea Verou and Chris Lilley<br />\n<em>Get LCH colors and their RGB counterparts.</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3docs.com/tools/color-hwb\">HWB color picker</a><br />\n<em>Visualize HWB colors and convert to HSL, RGB and hex.</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/5t3ph/a11y-color-tokens\">Ally Color Tokens</a>, Stephanie Eckles<br />\n<em>An accessible color token generator.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/nerds-guide-color-web/\">A Nerd’s Guide To Color On The Web</a>,” Sarah Drasner, CSS-Tricks</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/\">LCH Colors In CSS: What, Why, And How?</a>,” Lea Verou</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/the-best-color-functions-in-css/\">The Best Color Functions In CSS?</a>,” Chris Coyier, CSS-Tricks</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://web.dev/building-a-color-scheme/\">Building A Color Scheme</a>,” Adam Argyle, Web.dev</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/hsl-colors-css/\">Using HSL Colors In CSS</a>,” Ahmad Shaheed, Smashing Magazine</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/hex-rgb-to-hsl/\">On Switching From Hex And RGB To HSL</a>,” Sara Soueidan</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/6682/improving-color-on-the-web/\">Improving Color On The Web</a>,” Dean Jackson, Webkit Blog</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"signature\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/logo/logo--red.png\" alt=\"Smashing Editorial\" width=\"35\" height=\"46\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" />\n  <span>(vf, il)</span>\n</div>\n\n\n              </article>\n            </body>\n          </html>\n        "

We can look up at the clouds every minute and watch a whole new formation. The physical world is transient and ever-changing. What if our designs were a little more like this?</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-357344\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, we spend hours, weeks, even months carefully crafting our websites/applications, sculpting every last pixel until they are <em>just right</em>.

For those familiar with <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/g/generative-art\">generative art</a> — art made using a system that includes an element of autonomy — this is likely a familiar concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For makers (particularly perfectionists like me!), this approach to design can be incredibly liberating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the folk who <em>use</em> the things we make, it creates an experience that is truly individual. In randomizing carefully chosen aspects of our interfaces, they become ephemeral, and to me, this is kind of magical. No two people will ever see the same version of our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web can be a cold, sterile place. By embracing the unpredictable, we can add a joyful, organic touch to our creations — to me, this is the essence of generative UI design, and I would love if you gave it a try! SVG, Canvas, and CSS/Paint API are all excellent mediums for generative work, so pick the one that is most familiar and experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember: apply carefully, and always be mindful of accessibility/UX. Magically evolving designs are great, but only if they are great for everyone.</p>\n"

Memoization improves performance by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning those cached results when they&#8217;re needed again.</strong></p>\n<p>We’ll cover the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how React renders the UI</li>\n<li>why there’s a need for React memoization</li>\n<li>how we can implement memoization for functional and class components</li>\n<li>things to keep in mind regarding memoization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This article assumes you have a basic understanding of class and functional components in React. If you&#8217;d like to brush up on those topics, check out the official React docs on <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html\">components and props</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howreactrenderstheui\">How React Renders the UI</h2>\n<p>Before going into the details of memoization in React, let&#8217;s first have a look at how React renders the UI using a virtual DOM. </p>\n<p>The regular DOM basically contains a set of nodes represented as a tree. Each node in the DOM is a representation of a UI element. Whenever there&#8217;s a state change in your application, the respective node for that UI element and all its children get updated in the DOM and then the UI is re-painted to reflect the updated changes.</p>\n<p>Updating the nodes is faster with the help of efficient tree algorithms, but the re-painting is slow and can have a performance impact when that DOM has a large number of UI elements. Therefore, the virtual DOM was introduced in React. </p>\n<p>This is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Now, whenever there&#8217;s any change in the application&#8217;s state, instead of directly updating the real DOM, React creates a new virtual DOM. React then compares this new virtual DOM with the previously created virtual DOM to find the differences that need to be repainted. </p>\n<p>Using these differences, the virtual DOM will update the real DOM efficiently with the changes. This improves performance, because instead of simply updating the UI element and all its children, the virtual DOM will efficiently update only the necessary and minimal changes in the real DOM.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyweneedmemoizationinreact\">Why We Need Memoization in React</h2>\n<p>In the previous section, we saw how React efficiently performs DOM updates using a virtual DOM to improve performance. In this section, we&#8217;ll look at a use case that explains the need for memoization for further performance boost.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll create a parent class that contains a button to increment a state variable called <code>count</code>. The parent component also has a call to a child component, passing a prop to it. We&#8217;ve also added <code>console.log()</code> statements in render the method of both the classes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">//Parent.js\r\nclass Parent extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = { count: 0 };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  handleClick = () =&gt; {\r\n    this.setState((prevState) =&gt; {\r\n      return { count: prevState.count + 1 };\r\n    });\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    console.log(\"Parent render\");\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;div className=\"App\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;h2&gt;{this.state.count}&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n        &lt;Child name={\"joe\"} /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Parent;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The complete code for this example is available on <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/adoring-flower-c7zu0\">CodeSandbox</a>. <!-- https://codesandbox.io/s/nostalgic-diffie-7fetc --></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll create a <code>Child</code> class that accepts a prop passed by the parent component and displays it in the UI:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">//Child.js\r\nclass Child extends React.Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    console.log(\"Child render\");\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;h2&gt;{this.props.name}&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Child;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Whenever we click the button in the parent component, the count value changes. Since this is a state change, the parent component’s render method is called. </p>\n<p>The props passed to the child class remain the same for every parent re-render, so the child component should not re-render. Yet, when we run the above code and keep incrementing the count, we get the following output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">Parent render\r\nChild render\r\nParent render\r\nChild render\r\nParent render\r\nChild render\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can increment the count for the above example yourself in the following sandbox and see the console for the output:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/patient-currying-j2x3z?fontsize=14&#038;hidenavigation=1&#038;theme=dark\"\n style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n title=\"patient-currying-j2x3z\"\n allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"></iframe><br />\n <!-- https://codesandbox.io/embed/nostalgic-diffie-7fetc --></p>\n<p>From this output, we can see that, when the parent component re-renders, it will also re-render the child component — even when the props passed to the child component are unchanged. This will cause the child’s virtual DOM to perform a difference check with the previous virtual DOM. Since we have no difference in the child component — as the props are the same for all re-renders — the real DOM isn&#8217;t updated. </p>\n<p>We do have a performance benefit where the real DOM is not updated unnecessarily, but we can see here that, even when there was no actual change in the child component, the new virtual DOM was created and a difference check was performed. For small React components, this performance is negligible, but for large components, the performance impact is significant. To avoid this re-render and virtual DOM check, we use memoization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"memoizationinreact\">Memoization in React</h3>\n<p>In the context of a React app, memoization is a technique where, whenever the parent component re-renders, the child component re-renders only if there&#8217;s a change in the props. If there&#8217;s no change in the props, it won&#8217;t execute the render method and will return the cached result. Since the render method isn&#8217;t executed, there won&#8217;t be a virtual DOM creation and difference checks — thus giving us a performance boost.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s see how to implement memoization in class and functional React components to avoid this unnecessary re-render.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementingmemoizationinaclasscomponent\">Implementing Memoization in a Class Component</h2>\n<p>To implement memoization in a class component, we&#8217;ll use <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent\">React.PureComponent</a>. <code>React.PureComponent</code> implements <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate\">shouldComponentUpdate()</a>, which does a shallow comparison on state and props and renders the React component only if there&#8217;s a change in the props or state.</p>\n<p>Change the child component to the code shown below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">//Child.js\r\nclass Child extends React.PureComponent { // Here we change React.Component to React.PureComponent\r\n  render() {\r\n    console.log(\"Child render\");\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;h2&gt;{this.props.name}&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Child;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The complete code for this example is shown in the following sandbox:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/memoization-class-component-forked-jwt2q?fontsize=14&#038;hidenavigation=1&#038;theme=dark\"\n style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n title=\"memoization-class-component (forked)\"\n allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"></iframe><br />\n <!-- https://codesandbox.io/embed/memoization-class-component-1c28o --></p>\n<p>The parent component remains unchanged. Now, when we increment the count in parent component, the output in the console is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">Parent render\r\nChild render\r\nParent render\r\nParent render\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>For the first render, it calls both parent and child component’s render method.</p>\n<p>For subsequent re-render on every increment, only the parent component&#8217;s <code>render</code> function is called. The child component isn&#8217;t re-rendered.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/implement-memoization-in-react-to-improve-performance/?utm_source=rss\">How to Implement Memoization in React to Improve Performance</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Your client also wants to take a look — but you don’t have time to migrate it all to a public server to give them a quick peek.</strong></p>\n<p>If you’re a web developer, chances are you’ve been in this situation plenty of times. And you probably spent those times burning a little midnight oil migrating things onto a public-facing server wishing there was an easier way.</p>\n<p>To all those tired-eyed web developers out there, I’m here to tell you that an easier way has arrived! In fact, a whole slew of applications and services are available to help make this process easier by providing access to your localhost from the Web. The ones I’ll be discussing in this article are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ngrok.com/\">ngrok</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pagekite.net/\">PageKite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel\">localtunnel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boringproxy.io/\">boringproxy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.browserstack.com/\">BrowserStack</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howisitpossibletoaccesslocalhostfromanywhere\">How is it Possible to Access localhost From Anywhere?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol\">secure tunnel</a> services online! These are services that provide you with a tunnel from the Internet to your machine.</p>\n<p>What that means is that they provide a publicly accessible URL, watch for calls on that URL, and forward those calls to your localhost server. All the confusing setup has been done for you; all you need to do is install an application and point it to your localhost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anoteaboutusingvirtualhosts\">A Note About Using Virtual Hosts</h2>\n<p>On my localhost, I’ve got virtual hosts set up. Without having the address from each service below listed as a <code>ServerAlias</code>, my server would refuse to play nicely. A few hours of confusion ensued. If you’re in the same boat, add a <code>ServerAlias</code> to your <code>httpd.conf</code>, replacing the ngrok address you see below with the address from the service you’re using:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\r\n  DocumentRoot \"/Users/patcat/Web\"\r\n  ServerName mytestsite.test\r\n  ServerAlias 350c0f8e.ngrok.com\r\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"ngrok\">ngrok</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ngrok.com/\">ngrok</a> is an application for Windows, macOS and Linux that creates a tunnel but also allows you to inspect all traffic that goes through the tunnel and replay that traffic for testing.</p>\n<p>You can use basic features for free and then sign up to access more advanced features. In order to use custom subdomains and reserved domains, you&#8217;ll need to sign up for a paid plan. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll be able to use the service, but will be given a random domain such as the <code>350c0f8e.ngrok.com</code> URL in the virtual host sample above.</p>\n<p>Ngrok&#8217;s plans as of May 2021 look like so:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1623147343ngrokplans.png\" alt=\"ngrok plans as of May 2021\" /></p>\n<p>One key advantage to ngrok is that it has no dependencies. You install ngrok and run it. Nothing else is required.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howtousengrok\">How to use ngrok</h3>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://ngrok.com/\">ngrok.com</a>, download the archive and extract it to wherever you’d like ngrok to live on your computer. Below are the basic steps, but if you&#8217;d like more details, we have another article on “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/use-ngrok-test-local-site/\">How to Use ngrok to Share a Local Development Site</a>” if you&#8217;d like more info.</p>\n<p>Open up a command-line terminal and go to the folder you extracted ngrok to. Run the following command to create a tunnel to your localhost on port 80:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">./ngrok http 80\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll see a screen like so:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1623147346ngrokrunning.png\" alt=\"ngrok running on port 80\" /></p>\n<p>In the example above, we’ve got traffic to a randomly generated ngrok address of <a href=\"http://42e474ef9799.ngrok.com\">http://42e474ef9799.ngrok.com</a> being forwarded to our localhost on 127.0.0.1:80.</p>\n<p>Open that URL on any device with an internet connection and you’ll be accessing your localhost from the Web!</p>\n<p>One of the more unique offerings ngrok provides is the ability to inspect past traffic. To do that, go to <a href=\"http://localhost:4040\">http://localhost:4040/</a> on your computer. You’ll access a dashboard showing inbound requests. You can click each request on the left and see details on the right for the headers and other data. My favorite use of this is seeing JSON data returned back from requests. The very basic layout of this when loading a simple HTML page looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1623147341ngrokdashboard.png\" alt=\"Viewing ngrok inbound requests\" /></p>\n<p>You can even replay a request by clicking the <strong>Replay</strong> button on the right. That will re-run a request for you over the tunnel.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ngroksadvancedfeatures\">ngrok’s advanced features</h3>\n<p><strong>Password protection</strong> allows you to prevent random members of the public from accessing your site:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">ngrok http -auth=\"username:password\" 80\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Custom subdomains</strong> are for when you don&#8217;t want to have to remember that randomly generated URL! If you sign up to a paid ngrok plan, you can reserve a subdomain so others can’t take it. The following allows you to view your localhost at nogophersinmytunnel.ngrok.com:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">ngrok http -subdomain nogophersinmytunnel 80\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Custom domains</strong> are for when you&#8217;d prefer to not have &#8220;ngrok&#8221; in your URL for the tunneled project. Paid plans allow you to use your own domains, rather than needing to use ngrok.com:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">ngrok http -hostname=\"tunnel.yourdomain.com\" 80\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can even tunnel to an IP address on your local network that otherwise would not be accessible to the outside world:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">ngrok http 192.168.0.27:80\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you can create a tunnel for other non-HTTP services:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">ngrok tcp 22\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are a bunch of other things you can do, from running multiple tunnels at once to creating a config file to save all these settings for future use.</p>\n<p>To read up on all that is possible, see <a href=\"https://ngrok.com/docs\">ngrok’s documentation</a>.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/accessing-localhost-from-anywhere/?utm_source=rss\">Accessing localhost from Anywhere</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

In this article, we’ll take a look at <a href=\"https://www.simplewebrtc.com/\">SimpleWebRTC</a> and how we can use the platform in implementing WebRTC technology. We&#8217;ll also look at other alternatives that could help us achieve the same goal.</strong></p>\n<p>If you need a bit of background regarding WebRTC and peer-to-peer communication, I recommend reading “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/the-dawn-of-webrtc/\">The Dawn of WebRTC</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-getusermedia-api/\">An Introduction to the getUserMedia API</a>”.</p>\n<p>Due to the complex nature of building custom WebRTC applications, this won&#8217;t be a step-by-step tutorial on building one. Instead, we&#8217;ll look at the libraries and the types of servers required to build your own reliable app. I&#8217;ll provide links of complete sample apps you can refer to while building yours.</p>\n<p>Our focus will mainly be on <strong>SimpleWebRTC</strong> as a platform. Later on, we&#8217;ll briefly look at other commercial and open-source alternatives that may help you accomplish the same.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatwebrtcis\">What WebRTC Is</h2>\n<p>WebRTC (Web Real Time Communication) is an open-source project that allows peer-to-peer, real-time communication between web browsers to stream live video, audio and data streams over a network. Modern desktop and mobile browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera and other Chromium-based browsers have already implemented this technology natively. This is good news, as users don&#8217;t have to install a third-party plugin or an app to access the technology.</p>\n<p>Older browser versions and legacy browsers such as Internet Explorer don&#8217;t have this technology. Users will need to use up-to-date browsers. You can check the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=webrtc\">full list of supported browsers</a>:</p>\n<p class=\"ciu_embed\" data-feature=\"mdn-api__RTCPeerConnection\" data-periods=\"future_1,current,past_1,past_2\" data-accessible-colours=\"false\">\n<p>Data on support for the mdn-api__RTCPeerConnection feature across the major browsers</p>\n<p>In January 2021, the WebRTC 1.0 specification was transitioned from <strong>Candidate Recommendation</strong> to <strong>Recommendation</strong> status by the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-webrtc-20210126/\">World Wide Web Consortium</a>. This is a remarkable achievement considering the technology was first released into the public 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>The WebRTC specification covers how browsers can access local media devices and how they can transmit media and generic application data to a browser using a set of real-time protocols. It does this through a set of JavaScript APIs which have already been covered by the articles linked to earlier. The specification also ensures that all communication is encrypted and that unwanted third parties can&#8217;t eavesdrop into the streams.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that WebRTC doesn&#8217;t cover everything such as <strong>signaling</strong>, the process of initiating a connection between browsers. This part of the specification was left out in order to prevent limitations with potentially new technology. A second reason was that WebRTC is primarily client-side technology, and issues such as sessions are best handled using server technology.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howsignalingworksforwebbrowsers\">How Signaling Works for Web Browsers</h2>\n<p>The very definition of WebRTC is peer-to-peer communication between web browsers. The reality is, most browsers run in computers that operate behind a NAT (network address translation) device, and optionally a firewall. The NAT device, usually a router or modem, allows computers with private IP addresses to connect to the Internet via a single public IP address.</p>\n<p>NAT devices protect personal computers from being directly exploited by malicious users over the Internet via the IP address. Unfortunately, it also blocks devices with private IP addresses from connecting to another private IP device over the Internet.</p>\n<p>To overcome this challenge, the <strong>ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)</strong> protocol was proposed by the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8445\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> to allow private IP computers to discover and connect to other private computers over the public network.</p>\n<p>This involves the use of a <strong>public signaling server</strong> that both clients can easily connect to. The peer computers connect to this server and use it to exchange IP addresses and ports required for the data sources and sinks. With this information, they can establish direct connection with each other and start streaming video, audio and data.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an animated demonstration:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/162141985401-webrtc-signaling.gif\" alt=\"webrtc stun only signaling\" /></p>\n<p><small>Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.frozenmountain.com/ultimate-guide-to-webrtc\">WebRTC Signaling</a></small></p>\n<p>To set up WebRTC signaling, the ICE framework requires you to provide two types of servers, detailed below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1stunserver\">1. STUN Server</h3>\n<p>The <strong>STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT)</strong> server does exactly what I&#8217;ve just described above. It simply provides a meeting space for computers to exchange contact information. Once the information is exchanged, a connection is established between the peer computers and then the STUN server is left out of the rest of the conversation.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example script that runs on the client, which allows the browser to initiate connection through a STUN server. The script allows for multiple STUN server URLs to be provided in case one fails:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function createPeerConnection() {\r\n  myPeerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({\r\n    iceServers: [\r\n      {\r\n        urls: \"stun:stun.stunprotocol.org\",\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Connections established via STUN servers are the most ideal and cost-effective type of WebRTC communication. There&#8217;s hardly any running cost incurred by the users. Unfortunately, the connection may fail to establish for some users due to the type of NAT device each peer is using. In such a situation, the ICE protocol requires you to provide a fallback, which is a different type of signaling server known as a <strong>TURN</strong> server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2turnserver\">2. TURN Server</h3>\n<p>A <strong>TURN (Traversal Using Relay NAT)</strong> server is an extension of the STUN server. Where it differs from its predecessor is that it handles the entire communication session.</p>\n<p>Basically, after establishing a connection between the peers, it receives streams from one peer and relays it to the other, and vice versa. This type of communication is more expensive and the host has to pay for the processing and bandwidth load required to operate a TURN server.</p>\n<p>Below is a graphical depiction of the entire signaling process involving first the STUN server and then the TURN server as fallback:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/162141985602-webrtc-signalling-complete.png\" alt=\"webrtc stun turn signalling\" /></p>\n<p><small>Photo credit: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity\">A complete architectural diagram showing the whole WebRTC process.</a></small></p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingacustomvideochatapplication\">Building a Custom Video Chat Application</h3>\n<p>While it&#8217;s possible to set up your own video chat solution using plain JavaScript code and free public STUN servers, not everyone will be able to connect with each other on your platform. Using TURN servers is mandatory if you want to provide a reliable service to all your users.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, setting up WebRTC platforms can be complex. Fortunately for us, we have all-in-one commercial platforms that make building a WebRTC video chat application a breeze. Let&#8217;s now look at how SimpleWebRTC can lift our burdens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsimplewebrtcis\">What SimpleWebRTC Is</h2>\n<p>SimpleWebRTC is a platform that provides an easy and cost-effective service for developers to build and deploy custom real-time applications using React. Specifically, they provide the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SimpleWebRTC SDK: a front-end library</li>\n<li>Hosting: STUN/TURN and SFU (Selective Forward Unit) servers</li>\n<li>Technical support</li>\n<li>Custom app development and WebRTC consulting services</li>\n<li>Single-tenant and on-premise infrastructure</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://talky.io/\">Talky</a>: a free video chat app built entirely with SimpleWebRTC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below are sample screenshots of some of the custom video chat projects they&#8217;ve helped their clients develop and launch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/162141986803-web-talky.jpg\" alt=\"web talky\" /></p>\n<p><small>Photo credit: <a href=\"https://talky.io/\">Talky</a></small></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/162141987204-web-tutoring.jpg\" alt=\"web tutoring\" /></p>\n<p><small>Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.simplewebrtc.com/consulting\">Web tutoring app</a></small></p>\n<p>The main WebRTC services provided by SimpleWebRTC platform include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>secure streaming of video, voice and screen-sharing</li>\n<li>end-to-end encryption</li>\n<li>support for up to 30 concurrent users</li>\n<li>unlimited rooms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In terms of pricing, they offer the following <a href=\"https://www.simplewebrtc.com/pricing\">plans</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small Group: up to 6 participants, starting from $5 per month</li>\n<li>Large Group: up to 30 participants, starting from $3 per month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Small Group plan has the benefit of having end-to-end encryption available over the Large Group plan. With the Small Group plan, 60–80% of the sessions are peer-to-peer connections where media streams never touch the servers. Bandwidth consumption for such types of sessions isn&#8217;t charged.</p>\n<p>With Large Group plans, traffic is routed through a server called an <strong>SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)</strong>, where all streams are metered.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that most commercial alternatives, which we&#8217;ll briefly look at later, have <em>per minute</em> pricing. At first glance, it does appear quite affordable. However, you do get charged for peer-to-peer connections, which is free for SimpleWebRTC.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/building-webrtc-video-chat-applications/?utm_source=rss\">Building WebRTC Video Chat Applications</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

We&#8217;ll set them side by side and explore their respective benefits and disadvantages to help you choose which one to use for your projects.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"layingoutthebasics\">Laying Out the Basics</h2>\n<p>Back in the good old days, a simple text editor was enough for developers to create and manage the large part of their projects. But since then, the Web has changed drastically. Nowadays, it&#8217;s common for even a fairly simple project to have hundreds or thousands of scripts, with complex nested dependencies, which are simply impossible to manage without some kind of automated tool. And this is the place where package managers come into play.</p>\n<p>A <strong>package manager</strong> is a tool that automatically handles a project&#8217;s dependencies in a variety of ways. For example, with the help of a package manager we can install, uninstall, update, and upgrade packages, configure project settings, run scripts, and so on. All the hard and tedious work is done by the package manager, leaving to us only the fun part — the coding itself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm\"><strong>npm</strong></a> stands for Node Package Manager. It was released back in 2010, beginning a new era in web development. Until then, the project dependencies were downloaded and managed manually. npm was the magic wand that pushed the Web to the next level.</p>\n<p>npm actually involves three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a <em>website</em> for managing various aspects of your npm experience</li>\n<li>a <em>registry</em> for accessing an extensive public database of JavaScript packages</li>\n<li>a <em>command-line interface</em> (CLI) for interacting with npm via the terminal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, when most people talk about npm, they usually mean the last one — the CLI tool. It ships as a default package manager with each fresh Node installation. This means you can start using it right away. </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like a deep dive into working with npm, please consult our <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/npm-guide/\">Node Package Manager Guide</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/\"><strong>Yarn</strong></a> stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator. The Yarn package manager is an alternative to npm, released by Facebook in October 2016. The original goal of Yarn was to deal with npm drawbacks, such as performance and security issues. Yarn was quickly positioned as a safe, fast, and reliable JavaScript dependency management tool. </p>\n<p>But the npm team learned their lesson and rapidly filled the npm gaps by implementing the missing features.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s quickly travel through time to see the big picture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2010: npm is released with support for Node.</li>\n<li>2016: Yarn is released. It shows much greater performance than npm. It also generate a <code>yarn.lock</code> file that makes sharing and exact replication of repos much easier and predictable.</li>\n<li>2017: npm 5 is released. It offers auto-generation of a <code>package-lock.json</code> file in answer to <code>yarn.lock</code>.</li>\n<li>2018: npm 6 is released with improved security. Now npm checks security vulnerabilities before dependencies are installed.</li>\n<li>2020: Yarn 2 and npm 7 are released. Both packages come with great new features, as we&#8217;ll see later in this tutorial.</li>\n<li>2021: Yarn 3 is released with various improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nowadays, both package managers are neck and neck in the package management race, offering similar features and capabilities. But there are still several differences that help to determine which we choose to use.</p>\n<p>In the rest of this tutorial, we&#8217;ll explore the main similarities and differences between npm and Yarn.</p>\n<h2 id=\"yarnvsnpmaninstallationcomparison\">Yarn vs npm: an Installation Comparison</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll start our comparison exploration with the installation process for both npm and Yarn.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installingthepackagemanagersthemselves\">Installing the package managers themselves</h3>\n<p>As I noted above, npm comes preinstalled with Node, so there&#8217;s no need to install npm manually.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Yarn needs to be installed explicitly. First, we need to install Yarn globally:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install -g yarn\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, we can use it on a per-project basis by setting the desired version inside our project. We do that by running the <code>yarn set version</code> command in the project&#8217;s root directory:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">yarn set version berry\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, <code>berry</code> is the version we want to set.</p>\n<p>If we want to update to the latest version, we run this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">yarn set version latest\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>With Yarn we can use a different version for each project.</p>\n<p>To do the same with npm, you&#8217;ll need to have <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\">nvm (Node Version Manager)</a> installed. Here&#8217;s how to <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">install multiple versions of Node using nvm</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installingprojectdependencies\">Installing project dependencies</h3>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s see how project dependencies are installed.</p>\n<p>When we run <code>npm install</code>, the dependencies are installed sequentially, one after another. The output logs in the terminal are informative but a bit hard to read.</p>\n<p>To install the packages with Yarn, we run the <code>yarn</code> command. Yarn installs packages in parallel, which is one of the reasons it&#8217;s quicker than npm. If you&#8217;re using Yarn 1, you&#8217;ll see that the yarn output logs are clean, visually distinguishable and brief. They&#8217;re also ordered in a tree form for easy comprehension. But this is changed in versions 2 and 3, where the logs aren&#8217;t so intuitive and human-readable.</p>\n<p>So far, we&#8217;ve seen that npm and Yarn have different commands for installing packages. In the next section, we&#8217;ll explore more commands.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/yarn-vs-npm/?utm_source=rss\">Yarn vs npm: Everything You Need to Know</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

We’ll try to help you understand if the move makes sense for your specific business. We’ll also describe the standard migration process by breaking it down into the tasks involved and the likely amount of time the migration process will take.</strong></p>\n<p>The Magento team terminated official support of the platform’s first version in June 2020. Yet the number of stores that are still up and running on Magento 1 is quite high. So should these business owners be thinking about Magento 2 migration?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634612835magento-1-magento-2.jpg\" alt=\"Magento 1 to Magento 2 migration\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofmagento\">The Benefits of Magento</h2>\n<p>Magento is a platform used for building highly customized and large ecommerce stores.</p>\n<p>Although it has a rather complex architecture (which explains its tricky development and maintenance), the platform offers practically no limits when it comes to building something custom and unique. As a result, it offers a lot more than other ecommerce platforms such as Shopify.</p>\n<p>Magento is an extremely versatile platform, where you can implement any functionality you like. Yes, it requires a team of experienced developers. But whether it&#8217;s boosting site speed, enhancing the search, reworking the design, or <a href=\"https://onilab.com/blog/how-to-build-a-pwa-storefront-magento-2-a-detailed-guide\">building a Magento 2 PWA</a>, site improvements using progressive technology can certainly make a change for the better — even if we’re talking about “heavy” stores with non-standard design and non-typical storefronts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"issuessurroundingmagento2migration\">Issues Surrounding Magento 2 Migration</h2>\n<p>The major point of contention surrounding Magento 1 to Magento 2 migration is that <strong>Magento 1 and Magento 2 have very little in common</strong>. And if a store is up on Magento 1 (usually a big one that’s been operating online for years), it will take a lot of effort and time to migrate it to Magento 2.</p>\n<p>Whether you like it or not, most of the code will need to be rewritten. And you&#8217;ll have to deal with Magento extensions, plugins, compatibility issues, data migration, and so forth — all which is very challenging.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634613236magento-migration-frustration.jpg\" alt=\"Challenges of Magento 2 migration\" /></p>\n<p>Intimidated by the complex, lengthy process and the possible costs involved, it&#8217;s no wonder numerous store owners have decided to postpone their Magento 1 to Magento 2 migration. Many have even started to look for other, less complex platforms to move to instead. Others are choosing to leave things as they are.</p>\n<p>But sticking with Magento 1 isn&#8217;t recommended. Investing in Magento 2 migration makes sense for one reason in particular, which was mentioned above: <strong>the official Magento team has decided to terminate support for Magento 1</strong>. This means that, from June 2020, there will be no more security patches, no more updates — nothing. As a result, Magento 1.x is becoming more and more out of date by the month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theadvantagesofmagento2migration\">The Advantages of Magento 2 Migration</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s no reason an online store can&#8217;t function perfectly well on Magento 1. But there are increasing disadvantages and risks in relying on outdated software. Security is becoming more and more of an issue, so it&#8217;s important to keep a site up to date for that reason alone — especially when you&#8217;re handling credit cards. And outdated software is less and less compatible with the modern code environments in which online stores live.</p>\n<p>By migrating from Magento 1 to Magento 2, site owners can mitigate large data leaks and credit card fines with a timely upgrade from an outdated platform.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the migration can mean that it’s time for: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>a redesign according to <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/web-design-trends/\">recent design trends</a> and a new store look (since moving the old theme will take almost as long as creating a fresher one from scratch)</li>\n<li>getting rid of loads of unnecessary data and unused logs</li>\n<li>enhancing the store with new advanced features and Magento extensions</li>\n<li>rebuilding the storefront to a progressive web application to reach utmost site optimization and a better user experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, Magento 2 migration can be an opportunity to change things for the better — especially keeping in mind how sweepingly m-commerce is picking up steam.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shouldiupgradetomagento2now\">Should I Upgrade to Magento 2 Now?</h2>\n<p>If you’re a Magento 1 store owner who’s in two minds whether it’s worth it or not, you have to understand how Magento 2 migration will affect your business and how much it will cost. So take some time to give answers to the following six questions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1doyoulackanyfeaturesthatmagento1doesnthave\">1. Do you lack any features that Magento 1 doesn’t have?</h3>\n<p>Magento 1 is a long-established platform with plenty of extensions, themes, and ready-to-use solutions that you can implement right away. Unfortunately, core Magento is no longer receiving new features.</p>\n<p>In addition to that, Magento 1 extension developers won&#8217;t be updating their products to add new features. Your only alternative is developing the required functionality yourself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2willyoumigratetomagento2eventually\">2. Will you migrate to Magento 2 eventually?</h3>\n<p>Most businesses will move to Magento 2 eventually. They just want to delay this move for one reason or another. But you have to understand that staying with Magento 1 will cost you a lot of money in terms of support and development. And the longer you wait, the more you might eventually end up spending.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3doesyourstoresdesignlookuptodate\">3. Does your store’s design look up to date?</h3>\n<p>If your design patterns are outdated and don’t meet online retail requirements anymore, it&#8217;s reasonable to update your website design along with Magento 2 migration, eliminating a vast amount of work. Maybe currently your website has many <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/worst-ux-mistakes\">UX\\UI mistakes</a> you want to fix? It&#8217;s counter-productive to spend money on a Magento 1 store if you&#8217;re going to spend more money on a Magento 2 migration sooner or later.</p>\n<p>And if your store’s mobile version is far from perfect (such as being slow, not user-friendly, hard to navigate, and so on), you’re already losing sales.</p>\n<p>With Magento 2, it’s possible to build progressive web applications that optimize your store’s mobile and desktop versions. PWAs work fast and can have UX and UI that look a lot like a native application. For example, check out the series of screenshots below, illustrating mobile-friendly layouts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632826697IMG_03.jpg\" alt=\"Pet City progressive web application on a mobile device\" /></p>\n<p><small>Screenshots taken on the official <a href=\"https://www.petcity.gr\">Pet City</a> website</small></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/magento-2-migration-process-explained/?utm_source=rss\">Is Magento 2 Migration Worth It?

It is also known as a data structure server, as the keys can contain strings, lists, sets, hashes and other data structures. If you are using Node.js, you can use the <code>node_redis</code> module to interact with Redis. This tutorial explains various ways of interacting with Redis from a Node.js app using the <code>node_redis</code> library. </p>\n<h2 id=\"installing-node_redis\">Installing <code>node_redis</code></h2>\n<p><code>node_redis</code>, as you may have guessed, is the Redis client for Node.js. You can install it via npm using the following command.</p>\n<p>[code]<br />\nnpm install redis<br />\n[/code]</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h2>\n<p>Once you have installed <code>node_redis</code> module you are good to go. Let&#8217;s create a simple file, <code>app.js</code>, and see how to connect with Redis from Node.js.</p>\n<p><strong>app.js</strong></p>\n<p>[js]<br />\nvar redis = require(&#8216;redis&#8217;);<br />\nvar client = redis.createClient(); //creates a new client<br />\n[/js]</p>\n<p>By default, <code>redis.createClient()</code> will use <code>127.0.0.1</code> and <code>6379</code> as the hostname and port respectively. If you have a different host/port you can supply them as following:</p>\n<p>[js]<br />\nvar client = redis.createClient(port, host);<br />\n[/js]</p>\n<p>Now, you can perform some action once a connection has been established. Basically, you just need to listen for <code>connect</code> events as shown below.</p>\n<p>[js]<br />\nclient.on(&#8216;connect&#8217;, function() {<br />\n    console.log(&#8216;connected&#8217;);<br />\n});<br />\n[/js]</p>\n<p>So, the following snippet goes into <code>app.js</code>:</p>\n<p>[js]<br />\nvar redis = require(&#8216;redis&#8217;);<br />\nvar client = redis.createClient();</p>\n<p>client.on(&#8216;connect&#8217;, function() {<br />\n    console.log(&#8216;connected&#8217;);<br />\n});<br />\n[/js]</p>\n<p>Now, type <code>node app</code> in the terminal to run the app. Make sure your Redis server is up and running before running this snippet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"storing-key-value-pairs\">Storing Key-Value Pairs</h2>\n<p>Now that you know how to connect with Redis from Node.js, let&#8217;s see how to store key-value pairs in Redis storage. </p>\n<h3 id=\"storing-strings\">Storing Strings</h3>\n<p>All the Redis <a href=\"http://redis.io/commands\">commands</a> are exposed as different functions on the <code>client</code> object. To store a simple string use the following syntax:</p>\n<p>[js]<br />\nclient.set(&#8216;framework&#8217;, &#8216;AngularJS&#8217;);<br />\n[/js]</p>\n<p>Or</p>\n<p>[js]<br />\nclient.set([&#8216;framework&#8217;, &#8216;AngularJS&#8217;]);<br />\n[/js]</p>\n<p>The above snippets store a simple string <code>AngularJS</code> against the key <code>framework</code>. You should note that both the snippets do the same thing. The only difference is that the first one passes a variable number of arguments while the later passes an <code>args</code> array to <code>client.set()</code> function. You can also pass an optional callback to get a notification when the operation is complete:</p>\n<p>[js]<br />\nclient.set(&#8216;framework&#8217;, &#8216;AngularJS&#8217;, function(err, reply) {<br />\n  console.log(reply);<br />\n});<br />\n[/js]</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/using-redis-node-js/?utm_source=rss\">Using Redis with Node.js</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Our chart will allow us to visualize the status of Covid-19 vaccination at the time of writing, and will display two types of data — showing how far away we are from the halfway target of both partially and fully vaccinating the global population. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634256218linear-gauge-cover-image.png\" alt=\"linear gauge cover image\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatalineargaugechartis\">What Is a Linear Gauge Chart?</h2>\n<p>Data visualization is an invaluable tool, given the vast amount of data being created and numerous possibilities for gleaning information from data. Data visualization is particularly useful for identifying trends, interpreting patterns, and communicating complex ideas to the target audience.</p>\n<p>A linear gauge chart represents a vertical or horizontal linear scale that shows the required values, with a color scale along with single or multiple pointers. The minimum and maximum values of the data range can be set over the axes according to the data being represented. The pointer position indicates the current value of the metric. </p>\n<p>A gauge chart can display a single value or multiple values using an individual pointer or a combination of markers. The pointer can be a needle or a line with a marker of any shape like a circle, square, rectangle or triangle.</p>\n<p>The linear gauge chart type is an effective visual representation for displaying how close or far the values are from the desired data point. </p>\n<h3 id=\"typesoflineargauges\">Types of linear gauges</h3>\n<p>The several types of linear gauges are thermometer chart, bullet chart, tank chart and LED chart. The mercury thermometer — consisting of minor ticks that displays the temperature with the pointer value — is a classic example of a linear gauge chart.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"thelineargaugevisualizationwellbebuilding\">The linear gauge visualization we&#8217;ll be building</h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a sneak peek at the final linear gauge chart. Follow this tutorial to learn how we build this interesting and informative linear gauge chart with JavaScript.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634256124linear-gauge-final-with-tooltip.png\" alt=\"linear gauge chart final version\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"thefourstepstobuildingajavascriptlineargauge\">The Four Steps to Building a JavaScript Linear Gauge</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s always useful to have some skills with technologies like HTML and JavaScript. But in this tutorial, we&#8217;re using a JS charting library that makes it easier to create compelling charts like the linear gauge even with minimal technical knowledge. </p>\n<p>There are several <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_charting_libraries\">JavaScript charting libraries</a> for visualizing data with ease, and here we&#8217;re creating the linear gauge chart with <a href=\"https://www.anychart.com/\">AnyChart</a>. This library is flexible, with <a href=\"https://docs.anychart.com\">extensive documentation</a>, and it consists some <a href=\"https://www.anychart.com/products/anychart/gallery/\">great examples</a>. Moreover, it has a <a href=\"https://playground.anychart.com/\">playground</a> for experimenting with code and is free for non-commercial use.

Create a basic HTML page</h3>\n<p>The first thing we need to do is make an HTML page that will hold our visualization. We add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> block element and give it an ID so we can reference it later:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Linear Gauge&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;style type=\"text/css\"&gt;      \r\n      html, body, #container { \r\n        width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0; \r\n      } \r\n    &lt;/style&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n  &lt;body&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=\"container\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The width and height attributes of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> are set to 100% so that the chart is rendered across the entire screen. These attributes can be modified according to requirements. </p>\n<h3 id=\"2includethenecessaryjavascriptfiles\">2. Include the necessary JavaScript files</h3>\n<p>The next step is to reference the JS links in the HTML page. We&#8217;ll use the AnyChart library for this tutorial, so let&#8217;s include the corresponding files from their <a href=\"https://cdn.anychart.com/\">CDN</a>.</p>\n<p>To create a linear gauge chart, we&#8217;ll need to add three scripts: the <a href=\"https://docs.anychart.com/Quick_Start/Modules#core\">core module</a>, the <a href=\"https://docs.anychart.com/Quick_Start/Modules#linear_gauge\">linear gauge module</a>, and the <a href=\"https://docs.anychart.com/Quick_Start/Modules#table_ui\">table module</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Linear Gauge&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;style type=\"text/css\"&gt;\r\n      html, body, #container { \r\n        width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0; \r\n      } \r\n    &lt;/style&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n  &lt;body&gt;  \r\n    &lt;div id=\"container\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n      // All the code for the JS linear gauge will come here\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.anychart.com/releases/8.10.0/js/anychart-core.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.anychart.com/releases/8.10.0/js/anychart-linear-gauge.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.anychart.com/releases/8.10.0/js/anychart-table.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n  &lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"3addthedatavalues\">3. Add the data values</h3>\n<p>The data for the linear gauge chart is collected from <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\">Our World in Data</a> and included in the code. On that site, we can see the percentage of the people having received one and two Covid <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations\">vaccine doses</a> for each continent in the whole world.</p>\n<p>Because (at the time of writing) none of the numbers is greater than 50%, we&#8217;ve kept the maximum limit of the axis of all the linear gauges as 50%, and we compare how far away from that mark each continent is, as well as the global figure. We indicate at least partially vaccinated figures with LED representation, and the fully vaccinated numbers with a bar pointer. We&#8217;ll see how the data is added in the last step.</p>\n<p>So then, our initial steps are all done, and now let’s add the code to make a linear gauge chart with JavaScript!</p>\n<h3 id=\"4writethejavascriptcodeforthechart\">4. Write the JavaScript code for the chart</h3>\n<p>Before adding any code, we enclose everything in a function that makes sure that the entire code inside it executes only once the page is loaded.</p>\n<p>Creating a linear gauge chart involves a couple of steps and is a bit more complex than the other basic chart types. But that doesn’t mean it&#8217;s very difficult, and we&#8217;ll go through each step to understand how the chart is made. </p>\n<h2 id=\"definingthelinearscaleandaxisforthegaugechart\">Defining the Linear Scale and Axis for the Gauge Chart</h2>\n<p>We have multiple pointers in our chart. So, let’s start with making a function that accepts two values: one for the bar pointer, and one for the LED gauge. We&#8217;ll then create a gauge, set the data, and specify the layout as horizontal. Next, we&#8217;ll set the range of the scales and the axes. We&#8217;ll make a linear scale with the minimum and maximum ranges. For the axis, we&#8217;ll define the attributes and set the orientation:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function drawGauge(value, settings) {\r\n  // Create gauge with settings\r\n  const gauge = anychart.gauges.linear();\r\n  gauge.data([value, settings.value]);\r\n  gauge.layout('horizontal');\r\n\r\n  // Set scale for gauge\r\n  const scale = anychart.scales.linear();\r\n  scale.minimum(0).maximum(settings.maximum).ticks({ interval: 2 });\r\n\r\n  // Set axis for gauge\r\n  const axis = gauge.axis(0);\r\n  axis.width('1%').offset('43%').scale(scale).orientation('bottom');\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/create-linear-gauge-chart-javascript/?utm_source=rss\">How to Create a Linear Gauge Chart in JavaScript</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

            "<h2>\n  <a href=\"#what-is-astro\">\n  </a>\n  🚀 What is Astro?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Before getting started with Astro, the pertinent question is what on Earth is Astro?  To describe SvelteKit you can say it's NextJS but for Svelte and a lot of people instantly know what SvelteKit does.  Astro is a novel concept and so takes a little more explaining.  Let's talk about what Astro lets you do.  Astro lets you <strong>build fast apps with minimal JavaScript</strong> writing your code in HTML and vanilla JavaScript, React, Svelte or any mixture of those or a number of other languages.  It is already clear Astro is quite different to NextJS, SvelteKit or Gatsby.  What is does have in common with Gatsby is <strong>static site generation</strong>, though that is where the similarities end.  Astro has its own Go compiler and uses vite tooling under the hood.  This allows for a modern and more importantly <strong>fast developer experience</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As well as <strong>partial hydration</strong>, Astro offers an <strong>islands architecture</strong>.  Don't worry if you don't yet know exactly what those terms mean, that's what we will look into next.  In short Astro makes your app pages load faster.  You get control of how your components load.  You can instruct the browser to load a video part way down the page <strong>only when visible</strong>. Or the browser can work on your analytics code only <strong>when the main thread is idle</strong> (so we can optimise user experience) and you can even set certain components <strong>only to load on mobile or desktop</strong>. Now you see how different Astro is to other tools, let's take a deeper dive into the terms we introduced and how you can start using Astro.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#what-is-partial-hydration\">\n  </a>\n  🧊 What is Partial Hydration?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Although partial hydration sounds like the marketing hype you might find on a new gym training supplement, it is actually a smart and effective idea.  Essentially you send your page from the server to the client initially as pure HTML.  By default <strong>Astro ships zero JavaScript</strong>.  This is the secret to Astro's speed.  From your JavaScript 101 course though, you will remember it is the JavaScript which makes you page interactive.  That's where hydration comes in; hydration is the process of loading the JavaScript on your site page.</p>\n\n<p>What if your site does not need to be interactive? You might have an FAQ page which just contains questions and answers with no forms, video or anything interactive which needs JavaScript.  That's fine, we serve our page as pure HTML and never need to hydrate it.  Astro is great for this kind of content.  What if you wanted to add a comments section at the bottom of the page? Now you need JavaScript, but in fact you only need it once the user scrolls down to the bottom of the page.  Astro can hydrate that comment form at the optimum time, again allowing your page to load quickly.  Astro only hydrates the parts of the page which need hydration.  This is partial hydration.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#seo-benefits\">\n  </a>\n  SEO Benefits\n</h3>\n\n<p>As well as user experience benefits, Astro has Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) advantages.  With full hydration, essentially nothing is interactive until everything is interactive and the server ends up <a href=\"https://nicholasreese.com/lessons-from-building-a-static-site-generator/\">sending a larger bundle to the browser</a> and <a href=\"https://addyosmani.com/blog/rehydration/\">rehydration can heavily delay time-to-interactive</a>. This can impact <strong>first input delay</strong>, one of Google's Core Web vitals statistics.  It is <a href=\"https://yoast.com/a-primer-on-javascript-seo-for-wordpress/#h-seo-challenges\">vastly more expensive to download and run JavaScript than simple HTML</a>.  Limiting JavaScript to the pages or parts of pages that need it should mean search engines like Google can crawl more content from your site in the time window allotted to you.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#%F0%9F%8F%9D-what-is-an-islands-architecture\">\n  </a>\n  🏝 What is an Islands Architecture?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Islands architecture relates to the partial hydration technique we just looked at.  Astro's philosophy is to create <strong>Islands of Interactivity</strong> which the browser can hydrate independently.  Treating each interactive element as independent allows you to optimise how it loads.  For Core Web Vitals you will want a banner image at the top of the page to load instantly.  You could go for pure HTML, but showing a low resolution placeholder while you wait for the responsive image to load reduces cumulative layout shift. In summary typically you want your banner image to load instantly.  That is not the same for an image or video half way down the page. We can load these as they come into view.  Remember with partial hydration we ship just the JavaScript  we need.</p>\n\n<p>Another island of interactivity might be an image carousel.  What if you have different carousel components for mobile and desktop?  With islands architecture you can load the specific one you need and forget the other.  What about the chat bot that helps users with potential issues? Why not wait until the main thread is idle and then load it? All of these use cases result in your server shipping less code and the browser loading less code at a time, leading to increased efficiency.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#why-use-astro\">\n  </a>\n  😕 Why use Astro?\n</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>it is <strong>fast</strong> — you get better user experience and expect a SEO boost as a bonus,</li>\n<li>you can use a language you already know, <strong>React, Svelte, Vue, Markdown or plain HTML</strong>,</li>\n<li>you can mix components from different languages, letting you <a href=\"https://rodneylab.com/tags/sveltekit/\"><strong>gradually pick up Svelte</strong></a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Astro however, is not a one size fits all solution.  It excels at building static sites, though will not be ideal when you really need a server side rendered app.  As an example, let's say you were rebuilding Twitter. A static site does not fit this use case since you cannot fully customise for each user with a static model. Don't, however, interpret this to mean that you cannot have JavaScript or interactivity on a static site. You can still have a contact form or interactive feedback elements, the difference is that it becomes harder to customise them completely for a logged in user.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#how-do-you-create-a-minimal-astro-app\">\n  </a>\n  🧱 How do you Create a Minimal Astro App?\n</h2>\n\n<p>Blasting off on your new Astro project is as simple as typing a few commands to fire up the CLI and selecting <strong>Minimal</strong> when prompted.<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code><span class=\"nb\">mkdir </span>my-new-project <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"nb\">cd</span> <span class=\"nv\">$_</span>\npnpm init astro\npnpm <span class=\"nb\">install\n</span>pnpm run dev\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>During this setup process you can alternatively choose from a list of Generic, Blog or a few other project types for your launchpad.

So, if you find content referencing a snowpack config file ignore this.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><code>package.json</code>: this is the regular file you will be familiar with from other projects.  In here you will find default <code>dev</code>, <code>build</code> and <code>preview</code> scripts.  It is worth building locally frequently as you develop to check things work as expected.  To do this, stop your dev server then run <code>pnpm run build</code> and finally <code>pnpm run preview</code> to spin up the built static site.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>sandbox.config.js</code>: config for <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing\">running a CodeSandbox</a>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#public-and-src-folders\">\n  </a>\n  public and src folders\n</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><code>public/</code> this is like the <code>static</code> folder in SvelteKit.

In essence, the folder is for anything which does not need processing by vite or Astro.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>src/</code>: this is where your app files will go.  <code>src/pages</code> is used for file-based routing, which you might already be familiar with from NextJS or SvelteKit.  Essentially when you create a file in this folder, your app will have a page on the equivalent route.  So <code>src/pages/about.astro</code> content will appear on the <code>https://example.com/about/</code> page of your final app.  <code>.astro</code> files contain markup for your pages.  You can consider the code in them to be a superset of HTML, meaning valid HTML code works in them and there are some extra features.

This means you have access to the HTML head section in the <code>.astro</code> markup files and can add stylesheets and scripts.  If you are used to React this is a little different, as there is no need to add a package like <code>react-helmet</code> to inject SEO markup, for example, to the HTML head section.</p>\n\n<p>As well as the markup itself, the <code>.astro</code> files have an initial frontmatter section.  It is demarcated like Markdown frontmatter with three dashes (<code>---</code>) at the start and end.  However, it is more flexible than Markdown frontmatter and allows JavaScript and even top level await (no need to wrap your async function expressions as an IIFE).  You use the frontmatter section to import components. You can import React and Svelte components into the same file.  Import using the familiar JavaScript syntax, just use the filename as it appears on the disk (this is contrary to how earlier Astro version worked, which you may see in old example code).<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code>--------\nimport ExampleReactComponent from '../components/exampleReactComponent.tsx';\nimport ExampleSvelteComponent from '../components/exampleSvelteComponent.svelte';\nimport { Markdown } from 'astro/components';\nimport BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';\n--------\n\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;html</span> <span class=\"na\">lang=</span><span class=\"s\">\"en-GB\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;head&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;title&gt;</span>RodneyLab Minimal Astro Example<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/title&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;style&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"nc\">.container</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nl\">display</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">flex</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"nl\">flex-direction</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">column</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n        <span class=\"nl\">background</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">hsl</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n          <span class=\"n\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">--colour-dark-hue</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">--colour-dark-saturation</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">--colour-dark-luminance</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"nl\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">hsl</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n          <span class=\"n\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">--colour-light-text-hue</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">--colour-light-text-saturation</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">--colour-light-text-luminance</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"nl\">padding</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">--spacing-8</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">--spacing-0</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">--spacing-32</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/style&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/head&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we knows the basics, let's look at some of the Astro aspects in more detail.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#10-tips-for-getting-started-with-astro\">\n  </a>\n  🌟 10 Tips for Getting Started with Astro\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#1-getting-started-with-astro-vscode-integration\">\n  </a>\n  1.

Getting Started with Astro: Favicon\n</h3>\n\n<p>The minimal starter code includes a <code>rel</code> tag for a favicon in ico format.  If you prefer to use a PNG file you can, of course, just replace this.  Either way, place your favicon file, whether it is in PNG or ICO format in the <code>public</code> folder of your project and it will be included in your app build.  If you are building a Progressive Web App add all the icons needed together with the <code>manifest.json</code> file to the <code>public</code> directory.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of adding this <code>rel</code> tag to each route file in your project, use Astro layout files.  You can use these for content which is the same on many pages.  As an example you can normally include headers and footers in a layout file.  The expected location for layouts is a <code>src/layouts</code> folder.  Here we define <code>BaseLayout.astro</code> and include the <code>rel</code> tag (for the favicon) in the HTML <code>head</code> section:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;html</span> <span class=\"na\">lang=</span><span class=\"s\">\"en-GB\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;head&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;meta</span> <span class=\"na\">charset=</span><span class=\"s\">\"utf-8\"</span> <span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;link</span> <span class=\"na\">rel=</span><span class=\"s\">\"icon\"</span> <span class=\"na\">href=</span><span class=\"s\">\"/favicon.png\"</span> <span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/head&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;body&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;header&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"c\">&lt;!-- header content --&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/header&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;main&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"nt\">&lt;slot</span> <span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/main&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;footer&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"c\">&lt;!-- header content --&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/footer&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;html&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>We then import this layout into any page files in which we want to use it.  In this example code above, we include the header and footer in the layout.  Then the <code>&lt;slot /&gt;</code> tag serves as a placeholder for content from whichever pages chose to use the layout. As an example we could use this layout on our home page like so:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code>--------\nimport BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';\n--------\n\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;BaseLayout&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Home Page<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;p&gt;</span>Home page content.<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/p&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/BaseLayout&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything inside the <code>BaseLayout</code> tags gets inserted into the layout in place of <code>&lt;slot /&gt;</code>.  You see this cuts down on repeating boilerplate code.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#4-getting-started-with-astro-selfhosted-fonts\">\n  </a>\n  4. Getting Started with Astro: Self-hosted Fonts\n</h3>\n\n<p>Self hosting fonts can make your pages load faster.  The fontsource project supports many Google fonts and other open source fonts, making it easy to self-host in your project.  You can download the packages for any fonts you want to use.  For fonts which you use on every page, import in a layout file:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code>pnpm add @fontsource/montserrat\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code>--------\nimport '@fontsource/montserrat';\n--------\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#5-getting-started-with-astro-server-or-browser\">\n  </a>\n  5. Getting Started with Astro: Server or Browser?\n</h3>\n\n<p>At some point when working in React or Svelte, you will need to add a check to see if your code is running on the (build or dev) server or actually in the browser.  As an example you might run a media query in your React code to check if the user prefers reduced motion.  This involves accessing the <code>window</code> object, which will not be defined on the server.  Astro has your back here. To stop your code crashing, you can include a check to make sure it only runs on the browser:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight javascript\"><code><span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">ssr</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">import</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">meta</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">env</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">SSR</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">reduceMotion</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">!</span><span class=\"nx\">ssr</span> <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"nb\">window</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">matchMedia</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nx\">matches</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here <code>ssr</code> will be false when code runs in browser.  On the server, shortcut evaluation will result in <code>reduceMotion</code> being set to false without evaluating the second part where <code>window</code> is used.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#6-learning-astro-environment-variables\">\n  </a>\n  6. Learning Astro: Environment Variables\n</h3>\n\n<p>Environment variables offer a way to use private keys in your code, without including them in the files which you commit, for example to GitHub.  Typically you will need to include some environment variables which you need exposed on the client.  As an example, if you use hCaptcha on your forms, there is a site key which you need to submit from the user's browser to hCaptcha servers for each challenge.  You will also have some secret variables which you will never want exposed on the client.  To avoid accidentally exposing these secret variables, Astro, makes you add a <code>PUBLIC_</code> prefix to environment variables which you have to expose on the client.  You put these in the <code>.env</code> file as usual:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>PUBLIC_TWITTER_USERNAME=\"@askRodney\"\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>For convenience, you might import all client environment variables into a single configuration file:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight javascript\"><code><span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">website</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"na\">twitterUsername</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"k\">import</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">meta</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">env</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">PUBLIC_TWITTER_USERNAME</span> <span class=\"p\">??</span> <span class=\"dl\">''</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">export</span> <span class=\"k\">default</span> <span class=\"nx\">website</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>and then use them in any client side code where needed:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight javascript\"><code>  <span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"nx\">website</span> <span class=\"k\">from</span> <span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">../../configuration/website</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n  <span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nx\">twitterUsername</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">website</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#7-getting-started-with-astro-node-packages\">\n  </a>\n  7. Getting Started with Astro: Node Packages\n</h3>\n\n<p>You can use node inbuilt packages (<code>fs</code>, <code>path</code>, etc.) in Astro, you just need to prefix them with <code>node:</code>.  As an example in this snippet from a <code>.astro</code> file frontmatter, we look for blog posts in a particular directory in our project:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code>import fs from 'node:fs';\nimport path from 'node:path';\n\nconst __dirname = path.resolve();\nconst BLOG_PATH = path.join(__dirname, 'content/blog');\nconst directories = fs\n  .readdirSync(BLOG_PATH)\n  .filter((element) =&gt; fs.lstatSync(`${BLOG_PATH}/${element}`).isDirectory());\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use this in your <code>astro.config.mjs</code> file.  A great use case is to add the node path module to help you define path aliases.  Path aliases save you having to type out full relative path prefixes (like <code>../../</code>) and make refactoring easier.  You can define them in your Astro config file:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight javascript\"><code><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"nx\">path</span> <span class=\"k\">from</span> <span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">node:path</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// @ts-check</span>\n<span class=\"k\">export</span> <span class=\"k\">default</span> <span class=\"cm\">/** @type {import('astro').AstroUserConfig} */</span> <span class=\"p\">({</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// Comment out \"renderers: []\" to enable Astro's default component support.</span>\n  <span class=\"na\">renderers</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">@astrojs/renderer-react</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">@astrojs/renderer-svelte</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n  <span class=\"na\">buildOptions</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">sitemap</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">site</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">https://astro.build/</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n  <span class=\"na\">vite</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">resolve</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"na\">alias</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"na\">$src</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">path</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">resolve</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">./src</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n        <span class=\"na\">$components</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">path</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">resolve</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">./src/components</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n        <span class=\"na\">$layouts</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">path</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">resolve</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">./src/layouts</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">define</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">process.env.VITE_BUILD_TIME</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">JSON</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">stringify</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nb\">Date</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"nx\">toISOString</span><span class=\"p\">()),</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n<span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in your source files you can replace:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code>--------\nimport ExampleReactComponent from '../components/exampleReactComponent.tsx';\nimport ExampleSvelteComponent from '../components/exampleSvelteComponent.svelte';\nimport { Markdown } from 'astro/components';\nimport BaseLayout from '../layouts/BaseLayout.astro';\n--------\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>with:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code>--------\nimport ExampleReactComponent from '$components/exampleReactComponent.tsx';\nimport ExampleSvelteComponent from '$components/exampleSvelteComponent.svelte';\nimport { Markdown } from 'astro/components';\nimport BaseLayout from '$layouts/BaseLayout.astro';\n--------\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Props to folks in the <a href=\"https://astro.build/chat\">Astro discord</a> for this tip.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a href=\"#8-getting-started-with-astro-styling\">\n  </a>\n  8. Getting Started with Astro: Styling\n</h3>\n\n<p>Astro supports styled components, vanilla-extract, scss and many other flavours of styling.  Since we can't get through all of those here, let's look at good old CSS!  For your Svelte components, you can include scoped CSS styles like you would in SvelteKit, for example.  For React you can include styles inline, or opt for CSS modules.  In the demo code, we went for another Astro alternative.  We define the scoped styles in the <code>.astro</code> file which includes the React component.  For this to work, we need to use the <code>:global</code> selector.  Here we have the styles defined in head section of the <code>.astro</code> file:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code><span

There's not really time to get into it here, without the post getting too long.  I hope to be able to write a separate post on using it with Astro soon.  It will <a href=\"https://rodneylab.com/sveltekit-image-plugin/\">generate images for you in Next-Gen formats</a> and creates hashes.  It also creates images in different responsive sizes to include in <code>srcset</code> lists.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#wrapping-up-demo-playground\">\n  </a>\n  🙌🏽 Wrapping Up: Demo Playground\n</h2>\n\n<p>Although this is not a tutorial as such, most of the code samples came from a demo app.  There are Svelte and React components in it as well as some Markdown.

To hydrate a component in Astro you add <code>client:load</code> to the component's element (this is different to earlier versions of Astro where you used a <code>&lt;Component:load&gt;{content}&lt;/Component:load&gt;</code> syntax).  Anyway, you will notice that we don't have those attributes added in our code yet.  However, the videos still play.  Interestingly this is because they are iframes and so treated as independent documents.  In a real world app, you would want to lazy load these or at least have more control over how they loaded.  As it stands the page loads a little slowly, but remember this is a playground rather than a production app.</p>\n\n<p>Beneath the React and Svelte videos there is a button which should toggle the background colour.  Try cloning the repo and adding <code>client:load</code> to get a feel for how Astro works:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;ExampleReactComponent</span> <span class=\"na\">client:load</span><span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;ExampleSvelteComponent</span> <span class=\"na\">client:load</span> <span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/rodneylab/astro/tree/main/demos/getting-started-astro\">code for the demo is on GitHub</a>.  You can <a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/github/rodneylab/astro/tree/main/demos/getting-started-astro\">open the playground in StackBlitz</a> or just play locally:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight shell\"><code><span class=\"nb\">mkdir </span>getting-started-with-astro <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"nb\">cd</span> <span class=\"nv\">$_</span>\npnpm init astro <span class=\"nt\">--</span> <span class=\"nt\">--template</span> https://github.com/rodneylab/astro/tree/main/demos/getting-started-astro\npnpm <span class=\"nb\">install\n</span>pnpm run dev\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Also experiment with the other hydration props (you will need to tinker with the code for some of these to have a perceptible effect):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>client:idle</code></li>\n<li><code>client:visible</code></li>\n<li><code>client:media={QUERY}</code></li>\n<li><code>client:only</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/component-hydration/\">Astro docs for more details on how these work</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you found this article useful and am keen to hear how you plan to use Astro.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a href=\"#getting-started-with-astro-feedback\">\n  </a>\n  🙏🏽 Getting Started with Astro: Feedback\n</h2>\n\n<p>Have you found the post useful?

Most offer a quick and dirty way to experiment with client-side (and sometimes server-side) code then share it with others. Here&#8217;s our look at seven of the best.</strong></p>\n<p>Online coding playgrounds typically include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>color-coded HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editors</li>\n<li>code command auto-complete</li>\n<li>a preview window which (normally) live reloads without a manual refresh</li>\n<li>HTML preprocessors such as HAML</li>\n<li>Less, Sass, Stylus, and similar CSS preprocessors</li>\n<li>inclusion of popular JavaScript libraries such as React, Preact, Angular, and Vue.js (some newer playgrounds also allow back-end code development)</li>\n<li>developer consoles and code validation tools</li>\n<li>coding collaboration facilities</li>\n<li>sharing via a short URL</li>\n<li>embedding demonstrations in other pages</li>\n<li>code cloning and forking</li>\n<li>copying to code repositories such as GitHub</li>\n<li>zero cost for a basic service</li>\n<li>further premium services for a small monthly charge</li>\n<li>a way to show off your coding skills to the world!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They allow you to test and keep experimental code snippets without the rigmarole of creating files, firing up your editor, or running a local server.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of the better options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1codepenhttpcodepenio\">1. <a href=\"http://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://codepen.io/\"><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1628090414codepen.jpg\" alt=\"CodePen\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a> wasn&#8217;t the first, but it&#8217;s one of the most popular and best-looking code playgrounds. Co-founded by Chris Coyier of CSS-Tricks, the service highlights popular Pens (client-side demonstrations) and Projects (online integrated development environments you can use to build web projects). It offers a clean and functional user editing interface with advanced functionality such as sharing, embedding, an error console, external JavaScript libraries, popular CSS preprocessors, and more.</p>\n<p>CodePen PRO provides private Pens, asset hosting, a collaboration mode, and themes for embedded iframes starting from $8 per month.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2jsfiddlehttpsjsfiddlenet\">2. <a href=\"https://jsfiddle.net/\">JSFiddle</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsfiddle.net/\"><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1628090422jsfiddle.jpg\" alt=\"JSFiddle\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsfiddle.net/\">JSFiddle</a> was one of the earliest code playgrounds and influenced those which followed. It can be used for any combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript testing and offers a range of libraries and frameworks. Unusually, it can also simulate asynchronous Ajax requests.</p>\n<p>JSFiddle concentrates on code so you won&#8217;t find a range of social features such as highlighted demonstrations and sharing facilities. The interface is simpler than others and, unusually, you must hit <strong>Run</strong> to reload the results pane. However, it always feels snappy and its simplicity may be preferable to some.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3jsbinhttpjsbincom\">3. <a href=\"http://jsbin.com/\">JS Bin</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://jsbin.com/\"><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1628090420jsbin.jpg\" alt=\"JS Bin\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jsbin.com/\">JS Bin</a> was created by JavaScript guru <a href=\"http://remysharp.com/\">Remy Sharp</a> and is still managed by him. It concentrates on coding basics and handles them well. Unlike some other playgrounds, you can edit the whole of an HTML file including the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>As well as the usual options, libraries, and preprocessors, JS Bin was one of the first to offer a logging console, which is essential for JavaScript development. The commercial Pro account provides advanced features such as asset uploading, private bins, vanity URLs, and Dropbox synchronization. You can even <a href=\"https://jsbin.com/help/running-a-local-copy-of-jsbin/\">download and install JS Bin locally</a> if you&#8217;re concerned about privacy or don&#8217;t want others to see the state of your code!</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/7-code-playgrounds/?utm_source=rss\">7 of the Best Code Playgrounds</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

If some shortcuts don&#8217;t work, it could be due to changes in shortcuts in your editor or file format, or sometimes due to extensions installed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"easyvscodenavigationshortcuts\">Easy VS Code Navigation Shortcuts</h2>\n<p>This section presents all the Visual Studio Code shortcuts that allow you to navigate different parts of the editor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"openafile\">Open a file</h3>\n<p>Searching for a specific file, especially as the project gets larger, can chew up a lot of time. Even if you already know where the file is, it&#8217;s definitely handy to learn this keyboard shortcut to easily open files in your project.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"opensettings\">Open settings</h3>\n<p>Visual Studio Code comes with a lot of features and settings that you can change to fit your needs. This keyboard shortcut makes it easier to get to the settings whenever necessary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"togglesidebar\">Toggle sidebar</h3>\n<p>A lot of times you need more space for the open file you&#8217;re working on. So, this keyboard shortcut is handy to show or hide the sidebar whenever necessary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"navigatetabs\">Navigate tabs</h3>\n<p>When you have a lot of tabs open and you need to move between them, one easy way to do it is with this keyboard shortcut, which shows you the list of the tabs and lets you navigate between them and choose which one you want to open.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep pressing <kbd>tab</kbd> to switch between tabs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"navigatetabgroups\">Navigate tab groups</h3>\n<p>One of the nice features that Visual Studio Code provides is creating tab groups. Tab groups allow you to split up your tabs into groups, and each editor group takes a part of the screen.</p>\n<p>This keyboard shortcut makes it easier and faster to navigate between groups in the editor group history. This shortcut also allows you to create a new group if the editor group you select in the shortcut is higher than the number of groups currently open.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd> or <kbd>3</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd> or <kbd>3</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"opentheterminal\">Open the terminal</h3>\n<p>During your development, you&#8217;ll most likely be using the terminal a lot. Visual Studio Code allows you to open a terminal window right inside the editor. This saves you from moving between the editor and the terminal and allows you to completely focus on the editor and the code.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632900480zen-mode.jpg\" alt=\"Terminal open in Visual Studio Code\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"openthecommandpalette\">Open the command palette</h3>\n<p>There are lots of commands you can execute in Visual Studio Code. These commands can be related to out-of-the-box features or extension features. </p>\n<p>With this keyboard shortcut, you can easily open the command palette. The command palette allows you to search through the commands you can use and execute them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<p>![Visual Studio Code command palette](Visual Studio Code command palette)</p>\n<h2 id=\"quickselections\">Quick Selections</h2>\n<p>During development, you&#8217;ll most probably need to make selections in your code, whether for copying, cutting, or other purposes.</p>\n<p>Instead of doing so with your machine&#8217;s mouse, doing it with the keyboard saves you time. These keyboard shortcuts focus on making selections quickly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"selectcurrentline\">Select current line</h3>\n<p>A lot of times you need to select the entire current line your cursor is at. This keyboard shortcut makes it very simple.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"similaroccurrences\">Similar occurrences</h3>\n<p>How many times do you need to rename a variable, or simply change a certain repeated text or phrase throughout the entire file you&#8217;re working with?</p>\n<p>Two keyboard shortcuts can be used in a situation similar to this. The first requires you to already have the word or phrases selected, while the other doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><strong>Current selection</strong></p>\n<p>With this keyboard shortcut, all you need is to have one occurrence of the text you&#8217;re looking for in the file selected. Then, by pressing the keys of the shortcut, you&#8217;ll select all its occurrences in the file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Current word</strong></p>\n<p>This keyboard shortcut allows you to do the same as the previous one, but without having anything selected. While the cursor is placed on a word, you can press the keys of this shortcut and the current word with all of its occurrences in the current file will be selected.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: on macOS, make sure to press <kbd>fn</kbd> at the same time as <kbd>F2</kbd>.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632900568current-word.jpg\" alt=\"Selecting each instance of a word\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"selectuntiltheendoftheword\">Select until the end of the word</h3>\n<p>When selecting a certain part of the code, you can easily move and expand the selection with this shortcut. You can use the right arrow or the left arrow to go in the direction you want.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd> or <kbd>←</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd> or <kbd>←</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"multipleselections\">Multiple Selections</h2>\n<p>Mastering these keyboard shortcuts will boost your development speed and makes you a coding hero. These keyboard shortcuts allow you to select across multiple lines to make necessary modifications or additions.</p>\n<p>This saves you from repeating yourself and saves you the additional time you&#8217;d spend doing the same operation across multiple lines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"selectacolumnorboxofcodebydraggingthemouse\">Select a column or box of code by dragging the mouse</h3>\n<p>Dragging your cursor across lines of code or text selects each line from end to end. But you can also select a group of lines only partially with this shortcut. Multiple lines will be selected, but only as much of them as you drag over.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + drag mouse across the lines</li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + drag mouse across the lines</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"selectacolumnorboxofcodewitharrowkeys\">Select a column or box of code with arrow keys</h3>\n<p>You can do the same as above but without using your mouse. Instead of dragging a mouse, you use they keyboard arrow keys.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd> or <kbd>←</kbd> or <kbd>↓</kbd> or <kbd>↑</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd> or <kbd>←</kbd> or <kbd>↓</kbd> or <kbd>↑</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632900605select-column.jpg\" alt=\"Selecting a column or box of code in VS Code\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"howtousefindresults\">How to Use Find Results</h2>\n<p>All editors, even simple editors, should have a find feature so that you can find certain words, like function or variable names, phrases, or blocks of code either in the current selected file or across multiple files.</p>\n<p>This section will go over keyboard shortcuts that will allow us to make the best out of the results of using the find feature in Visual Studio Code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"navigateresults\">Navigate results</h3>\n<p>You can use this keyboard shortcut to move between find results in the active file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux/macOS</strong>: <kbd>F3</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: on macOS, make sure to press <kbd>fn</kbd> at the same time as <kbd>F3</kbd>.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"selectmultipleresults\">Select multiple results</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the find feature to find certain bits of text so that you can modify a subset of these results, you can use this shortcut to navigate and select the find results in the active file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"selectallresults\">Select all results</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the find feature to do certain modifications with all the find results, this keyboard shortcut allows you to select all the find results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"codenavigation\">Code Navigation</h2>\n<p>As each file or project grows, it becomes harder to find certain parts of the code. Finding errors or going to the code at a certain line can be hard when doing it manually.</p>\n<p>These keyboard shortcuts save you the hassle and allow you to invest your time in what you actually want to do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gotoline\">Go to line</h3>\n<p>Finding code at a certain line is especially helpful when you get a compile or runtime error that specifies what line of code caused it. This keyboard shortcut eliminates the need to actually find the line yourself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows/Linux</strong>: <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>macOS</strong>: <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632900639go-to-line.jpg\" alt=\"Go to a specific line\" /></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/visual-studio-code-keyboard-shortcuts/?utm_source=rss\">42 Visual Studio Code Shortcuts for Boosting Your Productivity</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

You can then either play these tracks straight after recording them, or upload the media to your server.</strong></p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we’ll create a website that will use the Media Streams API to allow the user to record something, then upload the recorded audio to the server to be saved. The user will also be able to see and play all the uploaded recordings.</p>\n<p>You can find the full code for this tutorial in <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/mediastream-tutorial\">this GitHub Repository</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"settinguptheserver\">Setting Up The Server</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll first start by creating a <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a> and <a href=\"https://expressjs.com\">Express</a> server. So firstly make sure to <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">download and install Node.js</a> if you don&#8217;t have it on your machine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"createadirectory\">Create a directory</h3>\n<p>Create a new directory that will hold the project, and change to that directory:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mkdir recording-tutorial\r\ncd recording-tutorial\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"initializetheproject\">Initialize the project</h3>\n<p>Then, initialize the project with npm:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm init -y\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The option <code>-y</code> creates <code>package.json</code> with the default values.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installthedependencies\">Install the dependencies</h3>\n<p>Next, we&#8217;ll install Express for the server we&#8217;re creating and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon\">nodemon</a> to restart the server when there are any changes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm i express nodemon\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"createtheexpressserver\">Create the Express server</h3>\n<p>We can start now by creating a simple server. Create <code>index.js</code> in the root of the project with the following content:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const path = require('path');\r\nconst express = require('express');\r\nconst app = express();\r\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\r\n\r\napp.use(express.static('public/assets'));\r\n\r\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\r\n  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);\r\n});\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a server that will run on port <code>3000</code> unless a port is set in the environment, and it exposes a directory <code>public/assets</code> — which we&#8217;ll create soon — that will hold JavaScript and CSS files and images.</p>\n<h3 id=\"addascript\">Add a script</h3>\n<p>Finally, add a <code>start</code> script under <code>scripts</code> in <code>package.json</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"scripts\": {\r\n  \"start\": \"nodemon index.js\"\r\n},\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"startthewebserver\">Start the web server</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s test our server. Run the following to start the server:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm start\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the server should start at port 3000. You can try accessing it on <code>localhost:3000</code>, but you&#8217;ll see a message saying &#8220;Cannot GET /&#8221; since we don&#8217;t have any routes defined yet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingtherecordingpage\">Creating the Recording Page</h2>\n<p>Next, we&#8217;ll create the page that will be the main page of the website. The user will use this page to record and view and play recordings.</p>\n<p>Create the <code>public</code> directory, and inside that create an <code>index.html</code> file with the following content:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n  &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;title&gt;Record&lt;/title&gt;\r\n  &lt;link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"\r\n    integrity=\"sha384-KyZXEAg3QhqLMpG8r+8fhAXLRk2vvoC2f3B09zVXn8CA5QIVfZOJ3BCsw2P0p/We\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;link href=\"/css/index.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" /&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body class=\"pt-5\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;h1 class=\"text-center\"&gt;Record Your Voice&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=\"record-button-container text-center mt-5\"&gt;\r\n      &lt;button class=\"bg-transparent border btn record-button rounded-circle shadow-sm text-center\" id=\"recordButton\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;img src=\"/images/microphone.png\" alt=\"Record\" class=\"img-fluid\" /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This page uses <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/bootstrap-5-new-features-examples/\">Bootstrap 5</a> for styling. For now, the page just shows a button that the user can use for recording.</p>\n<p>Note that we&#8217;re using an image for the microphone. You can download the icon on <a href=\"https://iconscout.com/icon/microphone-2666576\">Iconscout</a>, or you can use the modified version in <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/mediastream-tutorial/blob/master/public/assets/images/microphone.png\">the GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<p>Download the icon and place it inside <code>public/assets/images</code> with the name <code>microphone.png</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"addingstyles\">Adding styles</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re also linking the stylesheet <code>index.css</code>, so create an <code>public/assets/css/index.css</code> file with the following content:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.record-button {\r\n  height: 8em;\r\n  width: 8em;\r\n  border-color: #f3f3f3 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.record-button:hover {\r\n  box-shadow: 0 .5rem 1rem rgba(0,0,0,.15)!important;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"creatingtheroute\">Creating the route</h3>\n<p>Finally, we just need to add the new route in <code>index.js</code>. Add the following before <code>app.listen</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public/index.html'));\r\n});\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the server isn&#8217;t already running, start the server with <code>npm start</code>. Then go to <code>localhost:3000</code> in your browser. You&#8217;ll see a record button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1629299628Screen-Shot-2021-08-18-at-6.11.13-PM.png\" alt=\"Record Page\" /></p>\n<p>The button, for now, does nothing. We&#8217;ll need to bind a click event that will trigger the recording.</p>\n<p>Create a <code>public/assets/js/record.js</code> file with the following content:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">//initialize elements we'll use\r\nconst recordButton = document.getElementById('recordButton');\r\nconst recordButtonImage = recordButton.firstElementChild;\r\n\r\nlet chunks = []; //will be used later to record audio\r\nlet mediaRecorder = null; //will be used later to record audio\r\nlet audioBlob = null; //the blob that will hold the recorded audio\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re initializing the variables we&#8217;ll use later. Then create a <code>record</code> function, which will be the event listener to the click event on <code>recordButton</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function record() {\r\n  //TODO start recording\r\n}\r\n\r\nrecordButton.addEventListener('click', record);\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re also attaching this function as an event listener to the record button.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mediarecording\">Media recording</h3>\n<p>In order to start recording, we&#8217;ll need to use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia\">mediaDevices.getUserMedia()</a> method.</p>\n<p>This method allows us to obtain a stream and record the audio and/or video of the user only once the user provides permission for the website to do that. The <code>getUserMedia</code> method allows us to access local input devices.</p>\n<p><code>getUserMedia</code> accepts as a parameter an object of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamConstraints\">MediaStreamConstraints</a>, which comprises a set of constraints that specify what are the expected media types in the stream we&#8217;ll obtain from <code>getUserMedia</code>. These constraints can be either audio and video with Boolean values.</p>\n<p>If the value is false, it means we&#8217;re not interested in accessing this device or recording this media.</p>\n<p><code>getUserMedia</code> returns a promise. If the user allows the website to record, the promise&#8217;s fulfillment handler receives a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream\">MediaStream</a> object which we can use to media capture video or audio streams of the user.</p>\n<h4 id=\"mediacaptureandstreams\">Media capture and streams</h4>\n<p>To use MediaStream API objects to capture media tracks, we need to use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder\">MediaRecorder</a> interface. We&#8217;ll need to create a new object of the interface which accepts the MediaStream object in the constructor and allows us to control the recording easily through its methods.</p>\n<p>Inside the <code>record</code> function, add the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">//check if browser supports getUserMedia\r\nif (!navigator.mediaDevices || !navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia) {\r\n  alert('Your browser does not support recording!');\r\n  return;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// browser supports getUserMedia\r\n// change image in button\r\nrecordButtonImage.src = `/images/${mediaRecorder &amp;&amp; mediaRecorder.state === 'recording' ? 'microphone' : 'stop'}.png`;\r\nif (!mediaRecorder) {\r\n  // start recording\r\n  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({\r\n    audio: true,\r\n  })\r\n    .then((stream) =&gt; {\r\n      mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);\r\n      mediaRecorder.start();\r\n      mediaRecorder.ondataavailable = mediaRecorderDataAvailable;\r\n      mediaRecorder.onstop = mediaRecorderStop;\r\n    })\r\n    .catch((err) =&gt; {\r\n      alert(`The following error occurred: ${err}`);\r\n      // change image in button\r\n      recordButtonImage.src = '/images/microphone.png';\r\n    });\r\n} else {\r\n  // stop recording\r\n  mediaRecorder.stop();\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"browsersupport\">Browser support</h4>\n<p>We&#8217;re first checking whether <code>navigator.mediaDevices</code> and <code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia</code> are defined, since there are browsers like Internet Explorer, Chrome on Android, or others that <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder#browser_compatibility\">don&#8217;t support it</a>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, using <code>getUserMedia</code> requires <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#privacy_and_security\">secure websites</a>, which means either a page loaded using HTTPS, <code>file://</code>, or from <code>localhost</code>. So, if the page isn&#8217;t loaded securely, <code>mediaDevices</code> and <code>getUserMedia</code> will be undefined.</p>\n<h4 id=\"startrecording\">Start recording</h4>\n<p>If the condition is false (that is, both <code>mediaDevices</code> and <code>getUserMedia</code> are supported), we&#8217;re first changing the image of the recording button to <code>stop.png</code>, which you can download from <a href=\"https://iconscout.com/icons/stop\">Iconscout</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/mediastream-tutorial/blob/master/public/assets/images/stop.png\">the GitHub repository</a> and place it in <code>public/assets/images</code>.</p>\n<p>Then, we&#8217;re checking if <code>mediaRecorder</code> — which we defined at the beginning of the file — is or isn&#8217;t null.</p>\n<p>If it&#8217;s null, it means there&#8217;s no ongoing recording. So, we get a MediaStream instance to start recording using <code>getUserMedia</code>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re passing it an object with only the key <code>audio</code> and value <code>true</code>, as we&#8217;re just recording the audio.</p>\n<p>This is where the browser prompts the user to allow the website to access the microphone. If the user allows it, the code inside the fulfillment handler will be executed:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);\r\nmediaRecorder.start();\r\nmediaRecorder.ondataavailable = mediaRecorderDataAvailable;\r\nmediaRecorder.onstop = mediaRecorderStop;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we&#8217;re creating a new <code>MediaRecorder</code>, assigning it to <code>mediaRecorder</code> which we defined at the beginning of the file.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re passing the constructor the stream received from <code>getUserMedia</code>. Then, we&#8217;re starting the recording using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder/start\">mediaRecorder.start()</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, we&#8217;re binding event handlers (which we&#8217;ll create soon) to two events, <code>dataavailable</code> and <code>stop</code>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also added a <code>catch</code> handler in case the user doesn&#8217;t allow the website to access the microphone or any other <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#exceptions\">exception that might be thrown</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"stoprecording\">Stop recording</h4>\n<p>This all occurs if the <code>mediaRecorder</code> is not null. If it&#8217;s null, it means that there&#8217;s an ongoing recording and the user is ending it. So, we&#8217;re using the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder/stop\">mediaRecorder.stop()</a> method to stop the recording:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">} else {\r\n  //stop recording\r\n  mediaRecorder.stop();\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/mediastream-api-record-audio/?utm_source=rss\">How to Record Audio Using the MediaStream API</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

I feel like I pretty much get how engines work now because of that blog post.

These platforms are great for brand awareness, but give you limited options when it comes to content ownership, audience access and monetization.</strong></p>\n<p>The best way to livestream is to build your own platform where you can invite viewers to watch. This strategy will protect you from censorship, gain you access to better analytics, and more options on how you can monetize your streams. You just need to be prepared to make time and financial investment in order to reap the benefits of having full control over your content.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll look at livestream platforms, their terminology and protocols. Then we&#8217;ll examine five livestream providers that enable content creators to maintain ownership of both their content and audience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"differentkindsoflivestreamplatforms\">Different Kinds of Livestream Platforms</h2>\n<p>To get started, at the very least you&#8217;ll need a livestream media server and your own website. There are three types of livestream platforms you can consider working with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>self-hosted</strong></li>\n<li><strong>cloud</strong></li>\n<li><strong>API-driven</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the <strong>self-hosted</strong> option, you&#8217;ll find a number of open-source and enterprise livestream media servers you can download and install yourself. You can host the software on a local server, or on a compute platform such as AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, Linode. You&#8217;ll also need to set up storage space for your livestream recordings and your on-demand video content. For enterprise servers, you&#8217;ll need to purchase a license.</p>\n<p>The <strong>cloud</strong> option is where the platform provider has already installed the software on their multi-tenancy infrastructure. All you have to do is simply create an account and you&#8217;re good to go. Scaling and technical issues are handled by the provider. You&#8217;ll be billed a flat rate per month for the license to use the software, plus infrastructure costs that you&#8217;ll incur while running livestream sessions.</p>\n<p>The <strong>API-driven</strong> option is similar to the <strong>cloud</strong> option, except that you only pay for the usage. This is a far more cost-effective pricing strategy, since you only pay when a livestream is running or when you&#8217;ve stored video content on their platform. These platforms also have far better documentation that&#8217;s suited to developers.</p>\n<p>While it appears that the most affordable solution is the way go, you may need choose the other options due to requirements such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>extra low latency</li>\n<li>24&#215;7 streaming</li>\n<li>local network only streaming</li>\n<li>access to technical expertise i.e. a web developer</li>\n<li>limited time to market</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features offered by platforms vary, and you may find a commercial provider has already implemented most of the back-end logic you need for your app. You should also note that, when it comes to pricing, long-term contracts are often priced lower per month than short-term contracts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h2>\n<p>Next, let&#8217;s get familiar with the main terminologies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A <strong>livestream</strong> is technology that segments video streams or files into small chunks, which allows viewers to watch without downloading the entire file. The term <em>live video</em> is referred when the recording is happening in real time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Video-on-demand</strong>, or <em>VOD</em>, is simply a service for streaming a pre-recorded show, film or event. When setting up a livestream session, you need to enable the record feature such that viewers coming later to your livestream can still watch the entire show from the start.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An <strong>encoder</strong> is either a hardware device or some software that takes a high-quality, uncompressed video source from a camera and encodes the video stream into a compressed format that&#8217;s optimized for transmission over limited internet bandwidth. Hardware encoders are more expensive but tend to be more reliable. Software encoders are more affordable, but they don&#8217;t run in dedicated environments, which makes them prone to interruptions from other applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <strong>livestream media server</strong> is software that accepts transmission data from an encoder and then re-transmits into multiple streams at different quality to be delivered to audiences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transcoding</strong> is the process of converting a compressed video stream into an even better compressed format that can stream with minimum buffering at the highest possible quality. This is done by the livestream media server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An <strong>edge server</strong> is simply a relay for streams originating from the livestream media server. Edge servers are often located near the streamer&#8217;s location and are used to offload the burden on the livestream server. They also help in reducing latency.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <strong>livestream video player</strong> is a JavaScript application than enables browsers and mobile apps to decode video streams coming from a livestream media server. They often have playback controls and can come with additional features such as ad integration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Latency</strong> is the delay often measured between the time a camera captures a frame till the time a streamer sees the frame on their device. With standard protocols, latency can vary between 10 to 40 seconds. Low latency protocols can achieve delays of less than three seconds.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"livestreamprotocols\">Livestream Protocols</h2>\n<p>Streaming an event from your location to your audience is essentially a for-step process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a stream on your server. This will provide you with an RTMP URL which you&#8217;ll use to upload your stream.</li>\n<li>Configure your encoder and hit the stream button. This will upload your video source to your server.</li>\n<li>Your server will receive your stream and transcode it into multiple streams with varying quality.</li>\n<li>A member of your audience will connect to your livestream server via your website. Depending on your viewer&#8217;s network speed, an appropriate stream will be delivered.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/162604061301-streaming-delivery-chain.png\" alt=\"streaming delivery chain\" /></p>\n<p><em>Credit: <a href=\"https://www.wowza.com/\">Wowza</a></em></p>\n<p>While there&#8217;s a number of protocols that have been developed for streaming content, there are only three that you should be concerned with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rtmp\">RTMP</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Real-time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)</strong> is a streaming protocol that&#8217;s used to transmit optimized streams from your encoder to your livestream server. If you&#8217;re concerned about security, you can use <strong>RTSP</strong>, which uses SSL. There&#8217;s also <strong>RTMPE</strong>, which encrypts streams using Adobe’s security standards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"applehls\">Apple HLS</h3>\n<p><strong>HTTP Live Streaming</strong> is the most widely used delivery streaming protocol supported by every platform. It uses a technique known as <strong>ABR</strong> (Adaptive Bitrate) to break down videos into smaller chunks (ten seconds or less). It then encodes the chunks into different quality levels, which allows viewers to switch to a different quality stream in the middle of the video.</p>\n<p>HLS has a latency that can vary between 10 to 40 seconds. There&#8217;s a newer variant called <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/enabling_low-latency_hls\">Low Latency HLS</a> that was released in late 2020. It allows for reduced latencies of three seconds or less.</p>\n<h3 id=\"webrtc\">WebRTC</h3>\n<p><strong>Web Real-time Communication</strong> is an open project originally developed for peer-to-peer communication. However, providers have figured out how to use the technology to provide unheard of latencies of <strong>500ms</strong> and less to deliver livestreams to viewers across a vast geographic distance.</p>\n<p>They have also figured out a way to scale up WebRTC to serve thousands of viewers, since standard WebRTC is limited to 60 participants in one session.</p>\n<h2 id=\"livestreaminterfacedevelopment\">Livestream Interface Development</h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve set up your livestream media server, you&#8217;ll need to build an interface where viewers will watch your livestream. The interface can be either a website or a mobile app. You&#8217;ll need to install a video player to connect and decode streams from your server. As you gather more traffic to your interface, your livestream infrastructure will scale up to keep up with demand and ensure a smooth streaming experience for everyone.</p>\n<p>Your platform provider will often provide you with a custom video player. Alternatively, they can recommend several options, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://videojs.com/\">Video.js</a>, which is open source and supports HLS and DASH by default. There are a number of community skins and plugins available that can installed to extend its features.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jwplayer.com/html5-video-player/\">JWPlayer</a>, which is a commercial player that supports HLS out of the box. It supports video gallery, 360 videos and ad integration. It starts at $10 per month.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theoplayer.com/\">THEOPlayer</a>, which is a commercial player with affordable pricing based on impressions. It comes with rich SDKs, and supports ad integration, analytics and digital rights management.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To build a mobile app, you&#8217;ll need to use a mobile SDK — Android or iOS. There are multiple ways you can build a website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>as a single page HTML</li>\n<li>using a content management system</li>\n<li>with server-based development — such as Django or Laravel</li>\n<li>as an <abbr title=\"single-page application\">SPA</abbr>/<abbr title=\"server-side rendering\">SSR</abbr> website with a Node.js or serverless back end</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A provider may supply you with multiple ways of connecting your website to your livestream server. These options include using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>embed scripts</li>\n<li>SDKs for server programming languages such as Node, Python and PHP</li>\n<li>a REST API</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Building your own branded website or mobile app allows you to implement additional custom features such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>user authentication</li>\n<li>chat streaming</li>\n<li>ad display</li>\n<li>email subscription</li>\n<li>payment collection</li>\n<li>measurement tools</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we&#8217;ll look at different livestream server providers.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/streaming-platforms-control-content/?utm_source=rss\">5 Streaming Platforms That Let You Control Your Own Content</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

They’re each more of a content optimization tool.</p>\n<h3 id=\"outranking\">Outranking</h3>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve done keyword research and added your target keyword inside <a href=\"https://www.outranking.io/\">Outranking</a>, the content optimization tool analyzes the top search engine result pages (SERPs) and shows you the average word count, number of images, and meta title/description length your blog post should have.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988839Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-3.12.54-PM.jpg\" alt=\"Outranking keyword analyzer\" /></p>\n<p>It also shows you how many words your competitors’ blog posts have, how many do-follow and no-follow backlinks they have, their domain and page authority, and their search engine rankings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988848Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-3.15.05-PM.jpg\" alt=\"Outranking SERP Analysis Results\" /></p>\n<p>In the &#8220;Keyword Data&#8221; tab, you’ll be able to find things like highest frequency keywords, related keywords, and some additional keywords for content.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988855Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-3.20.08-PM.jpg\" alt=\"Outranking Keyword Data\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes to data accuracy, Outranking uses the same engine as <a href=\"https://app.neilpatel.com/en/ubersuggest/\">Ubersuggest</a> to determine search volume, which makes it a bit more accurate than Surfer SEO.</p>\n<h3 id=\"surferseo\">Surfer SEO</h3>\n<p>Just like Outranking, <a href=\"https://surferseo.com/\">Surfer SEO</a> also shows you other related keyword suggestions and their respective search volume once you&#8217;ve added your main keyword.</p>\n<p>However, Surfer SEO includes a metric they call SERP Similarity Score, which can be used to decide whether you want to use a term as a secondary keyword or the main keyword of another blog post.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988830Keyword-Research-SERP-Similarity-Score.jpg\" alt=\"SERP Similarity Score\" /></p>\n<p>For instance, if you use the keyword “how to build muscle” and Surfer SEO sees that several pages that rank for that keyword also rank for another keyword like “gain muscle mass,” it will return a high SERP similarity. </p>\n<p>What does this mean, exactly?</p>\n<p>This means that Google considers both terms as almost identical, so you should add both of them to your blog post.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if Surfer SEO shows that two keywords have a low similarity score, you should think about writing two different articles that target each specific keyword.</p>\n<h4 id=\"contentplanning\">Content Planning</h4>\n<p>With Surfer SEO, you can plan content based on a keyword or your URL.</p>\n<p>When planning content using a keyword, Surfer SEO will give you multiple topic clusters, each with its respective user intent and search volume, as well as a set of keywords to use. Each topic cluster could be used as separate blog posts that could then link back to your main topic or pillar post. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988926Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-11.23.24-AM.jpg\" alt=\"Surfer SEO Topic Clusters\" /></p>\n<p>When planning content using your URL, Surfer SEO will give you keywords that you’re ranking for but aren’t using in your existing content.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988921Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-11.20.55-AM.jpg\" alt=\"Content Planning Based on URL\" /></p>\n<p>This is a great way to find blog posts that need optimization and featured snippet opportunities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"surferseovsoutrankingoutlinebuilder\">Surfer SEO vs Outranking: Outline Builder</h2>\n<p>This is where things start getting a little interesting. Both of these content optimization tools read through all the H2 and H3 tags from the top-ranking pages and give you headings you can use to build your outline. </p>\n<h3 id=\"outranking-1\">Outranking</h3>\n<p>Outranking generates optimized outlines using the top SERPs and Google’s People Also Ask sections.</p>\n<p>It then shows you the results in semantically grouped sections broken into H2 and H3 tags that you can easily drag and drop to add to your outline.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988863Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-9.48.22-PM.jpg\" alt=\"Outranking AI Outline Builder\" /></p>\n<p>Outranking also has a feature called Concepts, which are facts gathered from existing information that summarize the context of topics covered in each paragraph. </p>\n<p>For example, if we generate Concepts from the “Benefits of going vegetarian or vegan” H2 tag, Outranking will go through the SERPs data and find the closest H2 tag that it can with that exact content (“benefits of going vegetarian or vegan”) and pull out information from the paragraphs under that and create Concepts around it. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988872Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-10.17.56-PM.jpg\" alt=\"Concepts Builder Headings\" /></p>\n<p>Basically, it will read what’s underneath the H2 tag and extract the key information you need to include in your blog post. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988869Screen-Shot-2021-10-31-at-10.07.25-PM.jpg\" alt=\"Concepts Builder Sections\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"surferseo-1\">Surfer SEO</h3>\n<p>Just like Outranking, Surfer SEO also analyzes the top pages ranking on SERPs and suggests different titles and headings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988940Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-12.10.30-PM.jpg\" alt=\"Surfer SEO Outline Builder Headings\" /></p>\n<p>Once you open up the Headings tab, you’ll notice that Surfer SEO highlights the terms it thinks you should include in your blog post.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can see subheadings nested right under the main headings to keep the logical structure of your outline.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635988947Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-12.11.26-PM.jpg\" alt=\"Surfer Outline Builder Subheadings\" /></p>\n<p>You also have the option to add only the heading or both the heading and the paragraph.</p>\n<p>All of these suggestions are based on your competitors’ content. If you notice that Surfer SEO is pulling information from a website that’s not one of your direct competitors, you can simply remove them from the analysis.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a blog about vacuums and are writing a detailed review of a specific model, you can remove websites like Capterra or TrustPilot, since they’re more of a “user reviews” content website than full-on detailed reviews.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/surfer-seo-vs-outranking/?utm_source=rss\">Surfer SEO vs Outranking: Which SEO Tool Is Best for You?</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Good APIs have simple interfaces that are straightforward and easy to use. Behind this simple interface can be many complex system interactions, and those interactions can really muddy the waters of an otherwise clearly defined endpoint task. Over time, developers may be asked to &#8220;tack on&#8221; additional business logic for existing endpoints. Then before you know it, a single API call is making interactions with over a dozen systems as part of its main flow.</strong> </p>\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if we could develop a pipeline that&#8217;s straightforward but with the capability to add additional tasks later without obscuring the main flow? This article will show you how you can adapt an idea from WordPress, and programming in general, to give your APIs the ability to do more powerful interactions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarehooksactions\">What Are Hooks/Actions?</h2>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/\">hook (aka actions/filters)</a> is the name given to events and their related callbacks by the WordPress community. If you have any experience in programming, you might be familiar with callbacks and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern\">publisher–subscriber pattern</a>. During processing, a system may trigger an event which calls zero to many functions subscribed to that event. For instance, in response to loading a page, WordPress makes calls to functions for loading the header, loading a title, listing posts or looking for the right template. These tasks are run without cluttering up the main process of generating a page.</p>\n<p>The idea behind hooks is nothing new and wasn&#8217;t invented by WordPress. However, WordPress did a great job of implementing them during their server-side page processing lifecycle. This use of hooks, in my opinion, is probably the single greatest feature the platform has. With these hooks, users can write their own functionality — be it plugins or themes — that tie into WordPress and run whatever code you want right when it&#8217;s needed. Do you need to alter a header sent to the user? No problem: hook into the <code>wp_headers</code> event and you can alter the headers as you see fit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyusehooksinanapi\">Why Use Hooks in an API?</h2>\n<p>Hooks are good for many things, including triggering some side tasks, calling out to another system through a PHP cURL command, building an object and putting it into a task queue to be picked up by another system later, sending an email, and more. This can all be done without needing to cloud the main flow of a given endpoint (and possibly forcing a new API version in the process). </p>\n<p>If the endpoint is for creating a user, we can focus on creating that user record in the database and along the way just call out to whoever is listening during that process. Maybe after creating the user record, we send out an event that says &#8220;anyone listening to this, I just created a user and here&#8217;s their info&#8221;. Maybe some callback functions have subscribed to the event and are listening or maybe none are. The event doesn&#8217;t really care. </p>\n<p>With this system, we can have our APIs call out to code that may be written at some later time. We can do this without needing to touch the API endpoint code itself. To demonstrate how this might work, let&#8217;s change gears and show the basic mechanism of how we can get this started in a PHP API. Do keep in mind that, while we&#8217;re using PHP here, we can actually implement similar logic in web applications using other languages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildingthebasicmechanisms\">Building the Basic Mechanisms</h2>\n<p>To get started, we&#8217;ll need to be able to add a hook/action (which I&#8217;ll refer to as &#8220;hook&#8221; from now on). We&#8217;ll also need the ability to remove a hook and lastly trigger a hook. Once we define these mechanisms, we just need to make sure they&#8217;re included into the API and then locate places in our API where we might want to call these hooks. Below is one way we might want to set this up.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s <code>hooks.php</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">// Global array which will hold all of our hooks\r\n// We will reference this array in each function to add/remove/call our hooks\r\n// The code below should also be seen by any callbacks we write for the system later.\r\n$hooks = [];\r\n\r\n// Below are global functions that can be seen from our API code\r\n// The add_hook method will allow us to attach a function (callback) to a given event name \r\nfunction add_hook($event_name, $callback) {\r\n    global $hooks;\r\n\r\n    if ($callback !== null) {\r\n        if ($callback) {\r\n          // We can set up multiple callbacks under a single event name\r\n            $hooks[$event_name][] = $callback;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Super easy to implement, we remove the given hook by its name\r\nfunction remove_hook($event_name) {\r\n    global $hooks;\r\n\r\n    unset($hooks[$event_name]);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// When we want to trigger our callbacks, we can call this function \r\n// with its name and any parameters we want to pass.\r\nfunction do_hook($event_name, ...$params) {\r\n    global $hooks;\r\n\r\n    if (isset($hooks[$event_name])) {\r\n      // Loop through all the callbacks on this event name and call them (if defined that is)\r\n      // As we call each callback, we given it our parameters.\r\n        foreach ($hooks[$event_name] as $function) {\r\n            if (function_exists($function)) {\r\n                call_user_func($function, ...$params);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now that we have our <code>hooks.php</code> file created, we simply need to include it into our API so that these functions can be seen. Once this is done, it&#8217;s just a matter of inserting the hooks into our API using <code>do_hook</code>. </p>\n<p>As a simple example, let&#8217;s assume we have an API for registering a new user with our system. We may have a REST API endpoint called <code>/addUser</code>. In the name of simplicity, let&#8217;s also assume that the goal here is to simply insert a new user&#8217;s name and age into our database&#8217;s <code>users</code> table. Pretty straight forward, right?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">// POST endpoint for adding a user (part of a larger API class)\r\npublic function addUser($name, $age) {\r\n  if ($this-&gt;request-&gt;method === 'post') {\r\n    try {\r\n      $this-&gt;db-&gt;insert('users', ['name' =&gt; $name, 'age' =&gt; $age]);\r\n      return new Response(200, 'User created successfully!');\r\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\r\n      // Oops, something went wrong.\r\n      // Do some logging or whatever.\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // If not a POST request, return http status 400\r\n  return new Response(400, 'Bad request');\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code above is an overly simplistic and generalized view of how we might add a new user. The idea is that, if someone were to call our API&#8217;s <code>/addUser</code> endpoint, they would eventually arrive at this function where the name and age of the user is pulled out of the posted data. We first check to make sure they&#8217;re posting (as proper REST rules dictate) and then try to insert the user into the <code>users</code> table. </p>\n<p>Next, if the user has been inserted successfully, we want to call a hook to let any code listening that a user was created (this is similar to raising an event in other languages). </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/flexible-api-design-create-hooks-for-php-api-pipeline/?utm_source=rss\">Flexible API Design: Create Hooks for Your PHP API Pipeline</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Thanks to automation workflows, you can send personalized offers to customers at the relevant time, laying the groundwork for increased revenue.</strong></p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll take a look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what email marketing automation is</li>\n<li>the benefits of email marketing automation </li>\n<li>the steps you need to take to launch email marketing automation workflows in your own company</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ll also discuss the most popular email marketing automation software options to help you find the best one for you. And at the end, we&#8217;ll take a look at specific examples of emails that you can start sending out to your clients in a short time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thepotentialofemailmarketing\">The Potential of Email Marketing</h2>\n<p>The potential of email marketing can’t be ignored. Email ROI has risen to <a href=\"https://dma.org.uk/uploads/misc/marketers-email-tracker-2019.pdf\">$58 per each $1 spent</a>, according to the Marketer Email Tracker 2019 report.</p>\n<p>But, considering that <a href=\"https://smarterhq.com/privacy-report\">72% of consumers</a> only respond to personalized digital marketing messages, simply sending emails manually isn’t enough.</p>\n<p>In fact, personalizing emails manually is unthinkable with a decent amount of customers or plans for scaling your ecommerce venture or small business.</p>\n<p>This is where email marketing automation makes its grand entrance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatautomatedemailmarketingis\">What Automated Email Marketing Is</h2>\n<p>Automated email marketing is a workflow where emails are sent to subscribers automatically.</p>\n<p>However, these emails aren’t just robotically sent to anyone at any time.</p>\n<p>If your automated email marketing strategy is properly designed and well executed, <em>the right email is sent to the right subscriber at the right time</em>.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the content of automated marketing emails, a lot depends on your creativity. You could come up with almost any kind of email to send to your users. But technically, there are three main types of automated emails.</p>\n<p>First, there are <strong>triggered emails</strong>, also called <strong>autoresponders</strong>. These can be sent after a certain set time or after any predefined user action. For example, you could set up a triggered re-engagement email that’s sent when a user hasn’t logged on to their account in a certain number of days. Or, when a new user creates an account, an automated welcome email with recommended next steps could be sent.</p>\n<p>Similar to autoresponders are <strong>behavioral emails</strong>. The difference is that these are sent based on a user’s interactions with previously sent emails. For example, if a user clicks through your offer in one email but doesn’t complete the purchase, you could send them a follow-up with a discount code.</p>\n<p>Besides single triggered emails and autoresponders, you can also send automated <strong>email drip campaigns</strong>. An email drip campaign is a sequence of lead nurturing emails that work together to convert the lead by the end of the sequence. These automated emails can be triggered by a particular user action, but you can also send them on a schedule.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, all automated emails should reflect the point on the customer journey that the specific user receiving the emails is in. The emails should always be personalized in some shape or form, to match the subscriber’s intent and needs.</p>\n<p>In a way, automated marketing emails are similar to transactional emails. However, their main goal isn’t to share routine information. Instead, automated email marketing aims to engage the user and promote your products or services.</p>\n<p>And luckily, automated email marketing is easier to implement than it might sound. If you take the initial time to do it, you’ll end up saving a lot of time and creating extra value for your customers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofemailmarketing\">The Benefits of Email Marketing</h2>\n<p>If done right, a well-executed and personalized automated email can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>give an inactive user a reason to come back to your service, thanks to an offer on their favorite product category (<strong>re-engagement email</strong>)</li>\n<li>persuade a hesitant buyer to go through with their purchase and check out the items they left in the shopping cart (<strong>abandoned cart email</strong>)</li>\n<li>enlighten an overwhelmed user about the features and benefits of your complex service (<strong>informational email</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you automate your email marketing efforts, you’ll end up with emails that are on time, more personalized, and therefore more relevant to your customers. In short, email marketing automation lets you grow your business and you’re bound to benefit in various ways. Let’s take a closer look at what you can achieve if you set up email marketing automation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"increaseuserengagement\">Increase user engagement</h3>\n<p>First of all, automated email marketing increases user engagement. If your user sees an email that’s personalized to exactly match their interests, they’re more likely to open the email, click through the offer, and finally end up making a purchase.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improveuserexperience\">Improve user experience</h3>\n<p>On top of that, email automation improves the user experience. This is thanks to the fact that automated marketing emails are more personalized — and therefore more relevant. In fact, if you send automated emails with promotions or even just references to the kinds of products that a specific user is interested in, they’re more likely to feel satisfied with your service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildastrongerbrand\">Build a stronger brand</h3>\n<p>Next, automating marketing emails helps build your brand and create stronger customer relationships. Following from the previous two points, if you send your email subscribers personalized, relevant, and engaging emails, they’re bound to view your brand as reliable and helpful for meeting their needs. This way, they&#8217;ll more likely return and even recommend your brand to others.</p>\n<h3 id=\"easilyscaleyouremailmarketingstrategy\">Easily scale your email marketing strategy</h3>\n<p>Email automation lets you easily scale your email marketing strategy. With email marketing automation software, it doesn’t matter if you’re sending the email to 100, 10,000, or 1,000,000 subscribers. It&#8217;s true that coming up with relevant offers and creating the email templates takes time. But once you’re done with those, the automated email marketing software will do the heavy lifting and you&#8217;ll be able to save time and grow your business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"increaserevenue\">Increase revenue</h3>\n<p>Finally, sending automated marketing emails helps increase revenue. Let’s take cart abandonment emails, for example. <a href=\"https://www.klaviyo.com/marketing-resources/abandoned-cart-benchmarks\">According to Klaviyo</a>, cart abandonment emails can have open rates as high as 41.18% and can add an average revenue of $5.81 per recipient. Considering how easy it is to set up abandoned cart emails, it’s pretty much like finding money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"alwaysbeontimewithautomatedemails\">Always be on time with automated emails</h3>\n<p>In addition to all the benefits covered above, email marketing automation has the perk that you can always send it at the exact moment when it can be most relevant and helpful to your potential customers. If you rely on messaging your new customers manually whenever you get to it, you might either miss the clue or simply send the email too late.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetstartedwithemailmarketingautomation\">How to Get Started with Email Marketing Automation</h2>\n<p>As seen, there are huge benefits to gain from automating your email marketing efforts. But in order to reap the benefits, you must first set the whole thing up.</p>\n<p>So, how do you get started with email marketing automation?</p>\n<p>Let’s go through the necessary steps and find out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1setgoals\">1. Set goals</h3>\n<p>First and foremost, you should set your goals. What exactly do you want to achieve with email marketing automation?</p>\n<p>Most likely, your ultimate goal is to increase sales and revenue. More specifically, though, this goal breaks down into several other common email marketing goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/grow-traffic-capture-audience/\">increase website traffic</a></li>\n<li>obtain new customers</li>\n<li>reinforce brand image</li>\n<li>build relationships with existing customers</li>\n<li>improve email open rates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, keep in mind that these are only some of the most common goals and they’re quite general. Based on your own general goals, you should set measurable and time-bound objectives that help you carry out your strategy in a successful way.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to find out more about this step, you can take a look at this great <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/resources/create-an-email-marketing-strategy/\">Mailchimp guide</a> on how to create a winning strategy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2planthecontent\">2. Plan the content</h3>\n<p>Based on your goals and objectives, you should now plan your content. In other words, you should decide which types of marketing emails you&#8217;ll send. You can write the actual content a bit later.</p>\n<p>Now, is your goal building stronger relationships with existing customers and ensuring they’re loyal to your brand? In that case, you could set up <a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/birthday-email-marketing-guide/\">personalized birthday discounts</a>, based on the products and services your users have previously purchased.</p>\n<p>Or, if one of your goals is to get more people to sign up for an online course, you could send a drip email campaign before the course starts, introducing the course plan and maybe even offering early-bird and last-minute discounts.</p>\n<p>At the end of this post, there are many more automation examples to help you figure out your content plan. On top of that, there are great email templates available, with most email marketing automation tools also able to ease the content planning process.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the next step.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3chooseanautomatedemailmarketingtool\">3. Choose an automated email marketing tool</h3>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve planned which automated emails you’re going to send to achieve your goals, you can choose an email marketing tool to help you fulfill the plan.</p>\n<p>As there are many email marketing services out there, you should choose the one that’s easy to use for you, has the most important features, and matches the needs of your marketing strategy.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://websitesetup.org/best-email-marketing-services/\">an analysis</a> of different email marketing services, these are the essential features that you should be looking for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the facility to add email contacts in bulk</li>\n<li>detailed reporting</li>\n<li>high deliverability</li>\n<li>campaign management tools</li>\n<li>marketing automation tools (of course)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On top of that, A/B testing and email segmentation could be really useful features as well.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, though, that it’s easy to get overly excited about fancy features when choosing an email marketing automation tool. But if you’re just starting out with email marketing, you might not need the most advanced gadgets and features, like a landing page builder, a fancy <abbr title=\"customer relationship manager\">CRM</abbr>, or a Facebook ads integration.</p>\n<p>Luckily, most services offer a free trial or plan, so you can try out several marketing automation tools and make sure you only commit to the one that fits you best.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4assembleamailinglist\">4. Assemble a mailing list</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve set goals, created a content plan, and chosen the right email marketing tool, you can proceed with assembling a contact list. Now, if you already have a subscribers list, you can simply upload it to the email marketing software that you’re using.</p>\n<p>But if you don’t have a list, you should <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/lead-capture-form/\">set up a lead capture form</a> right away so you can already get some new signups while you’re setting up email marketing automation.</p>\n<p>In essence, you should come up with an offer so that your website visitors will give you their email address. This can either be a simple informative newsletter or a discount code. Or, if you have the content, you can offer an ebook or toolkit in exchange for the email address.

In this introduction to PostCSS, we&#8217;ll explore the advantages of PostCSS, how it works, and what its extensive range of plugins can achieve.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1635738723postcss1.jpg\" alt=\"Processing CSS with PostCSS\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"thevalueandlimitationsofpreprocessors\">The Value and Limitations of Preprocessors</h2>\n<p>Most CSS developers are familiar with preprocessors. Tools including Sass, Less, and Stylus introduced concepts such as file partials, nesting, variables, and mixins. Some features are gradually appearing in native CSS, but a preprocessor is still useful for managing large codebases and maintaining style and coding consistency.</p>\n<p>It may be difficult to imagine life without a CSS preprocessor, but there are downsides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preprocessors are not extendable or limitable</strong>. Most preprocessors are a black box which provide you a specific set of supported features. It may be possible to write custom functions, but functionality beyond the scope of that tool is remains impossible — such as inlining an SVG as a background image.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you can&#8217;t stop developers using options you&#8217;d rather avoid such as <code>@extend</code> or deep nesting. Linting can help, but it won&#8217;t stop the preprocessor compiling a valid file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preprocessors provide their own syntax</strong>. Preprocessor code may resemble CSS, but no browser can parse the file natively. The syntax is different and, if your tool changes or is unavailable, your code will require updates to make it usable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The benefits more than outweigh these risks, but there is an alternative &hellip;</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatispostcss\">What is PostCSS?</h2>\n<p>PostCSS is <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss\">not a preprocessor</a> (although it can behave like one). It&#8217;s a Node.js tool which takes valid CSS and enhances it. Even those using Sass, Less, or Stylus often run a PostCSS step after the initial CSS compilation. You may have encountered the PostCSS <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer\">Autoprefixer plugin</a> which automatically prepends <code>-webkit</code>, <code>-moz</code>, and <code>-ms</code> vendor prefixes to CSS properties which require them.</p>\n<p>On its own, PostCSS does nothing. It&#8217;s a parser which tokenizes CSS code to create an abstract syntax tree. A plugin can process this tree and update properties accordingly. Once all plugins have completed their work, PostCSS reformats everything back into a string and outputs to a CSS file.</p>\n<p>Around <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/main/docs/plugins.md\">350 plugins are available</a>, and most perform a single task such as <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import\">inlining <code>@import</code> declarations</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss-calc\">simplifying <code>calc()</code> functions</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/borodean/postcss-assets\">handling image assets</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint\">syntax linting</a>, <a href=\"https://cssnano.co/\">minifying</a>, and more. A more user friendly plugin search is available at the PostCSS <a href=\"https://www.postcss.parts/\">plugins catalogue</a>.</p>\n<p>PostCSS benefits include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You start with standard CSS</strong>. PostCSS is to CSS what <a href=\"http://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a> is to JavaScript. It can take a standard stylesheet which works in recent browsers and output CSS which works everywhere — for example, transpiling the newer <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/inset\"><code>inset</code> property</a> back into <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> properties. Over time, you could drop this process as more browsers support <code>inset</code>.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, some plugins allow you to parse preprocessor-like syntax which isn&#8217;t standard CSS, but you don&#8217;t have to use them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use the plugins and features you need</strong>. PostCSS is configurable, and you can adopt the plugins you require. For example, you could support <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import\">partials</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested\">nesting</a> but not permit variables, loops, mixins, maps, and other features available in Sass.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide a custom configuration for every project</strong>. A individual project configuration can enhance or reduce the set of plugins used elsewhere. The options are far more varied than any preprocessor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Write your own PostCSS plugins</strong>. A wide range of plugins is available for extending syntax, parsing future properties, adding fallbacks, optimizing code, processing colors, images, fonts, and even writing CSS in other languages such as <a href=\"https://github.com/ismamz/postcss-spanish-stylesheets\">Spanish</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Semigradsky/postcss-russian-stylesheets\">Russian</a>.</p>\n<p>In the unlikely event you can&#8217;t find what you need, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/main/docs/writing-a-plugin.md\">write your own</a> PostCSS plugin in JavaScript.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re possibly using PostCSS already</strong>. You may be able to remove your preprocessor dependencies if you&#8217;re already running a PostCSS plugin such as AutoPrefixer. PostCSS is not necessarily faster or more lightweight than using a preprocessor, but it can handle all CSS processing in a single step.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"installingpostcss\">Installing PostCSS</h2>\n<p>PostCSS requires <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a>, but this tutorial demonstrates how to install and run PostCSS from any folder — even those that aren&#8217;t Node.js projects. You can also use PostCSS from <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage\">webpack, Parcel, Gulp.js, and other tools</a>, but we&#8217;ll stick to the command line.</p>\n<p>Install PostCSS globally on your system by running the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install -g postcss-cli\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Ensure it&#8217;s working by entering this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">postcss --help\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"installingyourfirstpostcssplugin\">Installing Your First PostCSS Plugin</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ll require at least one plugin to do anything practical. The PostCSS <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import\">import</a> plugin is a good option which inlines all <code>@import</code> declarations and merges your CSS into a single file. Install it globally like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install -g postcss-import\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>To test this plugin, open or create a new project folder such as <code>cssproject</code>, then create a <code>src</code> subfolder for your source files. Create a <code>main.css</code> file to load all partials:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">/* src/main.css */\r\n@import '_reset';\r\n@import '_elements';\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then create a <code>_reset.css</code> file in the same folder:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">/* src/reset.css */\r\n* {\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Follow this with an <code>_elements.css</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">/* src/elements.css */\r\nbody {\r\n  font-family: sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n\r\nlabel {\r\n  user-select: none;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Run PostCSS from the project&#8217;s root folder by passing the input CSS file, a list of plugins to <code>--use</code>, and an <code>--output</code> filename:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">postcss ./src/main.css --use postcss-import --output ./styles.css\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have any errors, the following code will be output to a new <code>styles.css</code> file in the project root:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">/* src/main.css */\r\n/* src/reset.css */\r\n* {\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n}\r\n/* src/elements.css */\r\nbody {\r\n  font-family: sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nlabel {\r\n  user-select: none;\r\n}\r\n/* sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,...\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note that PostCSS can output CSS files anywhere, but the output folder must exist; it will not create the folder structure for you.</em></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-postcss/?utm_source=rss\">An Introduction to PostCSS</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

The general idea is to upload the file, read its contents, and store it either in files or databases that the web application uses. Organizations may also need to export data from a web app. For example, they might need to export the grades of all students in a class. Again, spreadsheets are the preferred medium.</strong></p>\n<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll discuss different ways to handle these files and parse them to get the required information using Python.</p>\n<h2 id=\"aquickspreadsheetprimer\">A Quick Spreadsheet Primer</h2>\n<p>Before parsing spreadsheets, you must understand how they&#8217;re structured. A spreadsheet file is a collection of sheets, and each sheet is a collection of data cells placed in a grid, similar to a table. In a sheet, a data cell is identified by two values: its row and column numbers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1623754877spreadsheet-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A spreadsheet\" /></p>\n<p>For instance, in the screenshot above, the spreadsheet contains only one sheet, “Sheet1”. The cell “2A” corresponds to the second row and first column. The value of cell 2A is 1.</p>\n<p>Although programs with a <abbr title='graphical user interface'>GUI</abbr> assign letters to the names of columns, when we parse the data, we will start row and column numbers from 0. That means, cell 2A will correspond to (1, 0), 4B to (1,3), 3C to (2, 2), and so on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"settingupthepythonenvironment\">Setting up the Python Environment</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll use <a href=\"https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/\">Python 3</a> to read and write spreadsheets. To read and write XLSX files, you need to install the Pandas module. You can do so through one of the Python installers: <code>pip</code> or <code>easy_install</code>. Pandas uses the <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/\"><code>openpyxl</code></a> module to read new spreadsheet (.xlsx) files, and <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/\"><code>xlrd</code></a> modules to read legacy spreadsheets (.xls files). Both these <code>openpyxl</code> and <code>xlrd</code> are installed as dependencies when you install Pandas:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">pip3 install pandas\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>To read and write CSV files, you need the <code>csv</code> module, which comes pre-installed with Python. You can also read CSV files through Pandas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readingspreadsheets\">Reading Spreadsheets</h2>\n<p>If you have a file and you want to parse the data in it, you need to perform the following in this order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>import the <code>pandas</code> module</li>\n<li>open the spreadsheet file (or workbook)</li>\n<li>select a sheet</li>\n<li>extract the values of particular data cells</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"openaspreadsheetfile\">Open a spreadsheet file</h3>\n<p>Let’s first open a file in Python.

You should also have a Netlify account and have Node installed on your machine. If you need any help getting set up, you can consult our guide on how to <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">install Node using nvm</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatyoulllearn\">What You&#8217;ll Learn</h2>\n<p>By the end of this tutorial, you&#8217;ll know how to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>deploy a React app to Netlify</li>\n<li>integrate Netlify Forms with a stateless form component (a form component that doesn&#8217;t use the state)</li>\n<li>integrate Netlify Forms with a stateful form component (a form component that uses the state to handle its data)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The completed guide to this tutorial is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/NetlifyForms\">GitHub</a>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"introductiontonetlifyforms\">Introduction to Netlify Forms</h2>\n<p>Netlify Forms is a feature of Netlify for managing and handling form submissions without having to write any server-side code. By adding a simple attribute to your HTML form tag, you can get up and running with Netlify Forms. Forms can also be submitted asynchronously with JavaScript, making it a great companion to sites powered by Vue, React, and other modern frameworks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"netlifyformspricing\">Netlify Forms Pricing</h2>\n<p>Netlify Forms is free to get started with, but there&#8217;s a limit of 100 form submissions per website per month on the free plan, and also some features like background functions and role-based access control are excluded while using the free tier.</p>\n<p>To exceed the form submission limit or make the excluded features available, you&#8217;ll have to upgrade to a different plan. You can do that on the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/pricing/\">Netlify pricing page</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingaformfornetlifyforms\">Creating a Form for Netlify Forms</h2>\n<p>Netlify Forms can be integrated with both a stateless form (a form that doesn&#8217;t use the state to handle its data) and stateful one (a form that uses the state to handle its data). In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll firstly create a stateless form to demonstrate how we can integrate Netlify Forms with it. But later on, we&#8217;ll refactor the stateless form into a stateful one, in which we&#8217;ll also integrate with Neltify Forms.</p>\n<p>Let’s start by creating and setting up a new React app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"createandsetupreact\">Create and set up React</h3>\n<p>Type the following command in your terminal to create a new React app:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ npx create-react-app netlify_forms_app\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here our app’s name is <code>netlify_forms_app</code>, but you can give it any name you wish as long as it’s not a restricted npm name. After the installation is complete, change into the newly created directory, then start the app with the <code>npm start</code> command in your terminal.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s clean up (optional) our app a little bit. In the <code>src</code> directory of the app, delete the following files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>App.test.js</code></li>\n<li><code>logo.svg</code></li>\n<li><code>setupTests.js</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We deleted these files because they aren&#8217;t relevant to us in our build. We can also delete the <code>reportWebVitals</code> file. Doing that requires that we also remove the import statement and the function call of <code>reportWebVitals</code> from the <code>index.js</code> file for our React app to compile successfully. Again, this is all optional, so you can just skip this if you prefer.</p>\n<p>Now, clean up the <code>App.js</code> file so that it looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// src/App.js\r\nimport './App.css';\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"creatingacontactformcomponent\">Creating a contact form component</h3>\n<p>In the <code>src</code> directory of our React app, create a <code>Form.js</code> file and add the following lines of code to it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// src/Form.js\r\nimport './form.css'\r\n\r\nexport default function Form() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;form \r\n      method='POST' \r\n      name='contactform' \r\n      className='contactForm'&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;input \r\n        type='text' \r\n        name='name' \r\n        placeholder='Enter your name' /&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;input \r\n        type='email' \r\n        name='email' \r\n        placeholder='Enter your email' /&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;textarea \r\n        name='message' \r\n        placeholder='Messaage'&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;button type='submit'&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we have a stateless React form. Now, go to the <code>App.js</code> file in the <code>src</code> directory and render the form. The <code>App.js</code> file should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import './App.css';\r\nimport Form from './Form'\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Form /&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\nexport default App;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"stylingtheformcomponentwithplaincss\">Styling the form component with plain CSS</h3>\n<p>In the <code>src</code> directory, create a <code>form.css</code> file and add the following style:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">// src/form.css\r\n.contactForm{\r\n  padding: 10px;\r\n  width: 90%;\r\n  max-width: 400px;\r\n  margin: 30px auto;\r\n  border-radius: 10px;\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n  gap: 20px;\r\n}\r\n.contactForm input, button, textarea{\r\n  height: 50px;\r\n  padding-left: 5px;\r\n  font-size: 18px;\r\n}\r\n.contactForm textarea{\r\n  height: 100px;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>There&#8217;s no need to write any fancy CSS, but you can add some tweaks if you wish. With the styles we&#8217;ve added, our HTML form now looks like the image below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632746546rRZ1v5gF.png\" alt=\"A simple contact form made with React\" /></p>\n<p>To see the result, you&#8217;ll need to change into the <code>netlify_forms_app</code> folder and start the server:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd netlify_forms_app\r\nnpm start\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>A browser will open up and you can view the result at <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"formhandlingwithastatelessreactcontactform\">Form Handling with a Stateless React Contact Form</h2>\n<p>A perfect example of a stateless React form is the one we created earlier. In this form, our input values aren&#8217;t controlled by the state. In this section, we&#8217;ll learn how to add a contact form to a stateless React app with Netlify Forms.</p>\n<h3 id=\"addingastatichtmlversionoftheform\">Adding a static HTML version of the form</h3>\n<p>The first step to enabling our form to work with Netlify Forms is to add a static HTML version of our form to the <code>index.html</code> file in the <code>public</code> directory of our React app. Why do we need to add this form? Adding this HTML form will help Netlify detect our JSX form, since the post-process bots can only parse HTML.</p>\n<p>For this example, we’ll add this HTML form right after the opening the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag in our <code>index.html</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;!-- public/index.html --&gt;\r\n&lt;form name='contactForm' netlify hidden&gt;\r\n  &lt;input type='text' name='name' /&gt;\r\n  &lt;input type='email' name='email' /&gt;\r\n  &lt;textarea name='message'&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are two attributes to note in this form: <code>name</code> and <code>netlify</code>. The <code>name</code> attribute will enable Netlify to connect with our JSX form, while the <code>netlify</code> attribute will enable Nelify’s bot to be able to parse our form. We also used the <code>hidden</code> attribute to hide the form from our users. There&#8217;s no need to add labels or a submit button to this form, since it&#8217;s hidden from our site.</p>\n<h3 id=\"addahiddeninputelementtothejsxform\">Add a hidden input element to the JSX form</h3>\n<p>In the <code>Form.js</code> file in the <code>src</code> directory, add a hidden input element with the <code>name</code> attribute set to <code>form-name</code> and the <code>value</code> attribute equal to the name of the HTML version of our form. These attributes are required to make our form work with Netlify Forms:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// src/Form.js\r\n&lt;input \r\n  type='hidden' \r\n  name='form-name'\r\n  value='contactForm' /&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The final version of our form now looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// src/Form.js\r\n&lt;form \r\n  method='POST' \r\n  name='contactform' \r\n  className='contactForm'&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;input \r\n    type='hidden'\r\n    name='form-name'\r\n    value='contactForm' /&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;input \r\n    type='text' \r\n    name='name' \r\n    placeholder='Enter your name' /&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;input \r\n    type='email' \r\n    name='email' \r\n    placeholder='Enter your email' /&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;textarea \r\n    name='message' \r\n    placeholder='Messaage'&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;button type='submit'&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>There&#8217;s one more step required for this form to start working: deploying our React app to Netlify. We&#8217;ll cover this in the next section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deployingtonetlify\">Deploying to Netlify</h2>\n<p>We can deploy our site to Netlify using a version control system like <a href=\"http://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, or we can use the drag-and-drop method, which requires us to transfer the <code>build</code> file created from running the <code>npm run build</code> command to Netlify <a href=\"https://app.netlify.com/drop\">drag and drop page</a>. Both methods of deployment will be covered in the following sections, but for this tutorial, we&#8217;re going to use GitHub for deployment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deploywithgithub\">Deploy with GitHub</h3>\n<p>Deploying our React app from GitHub will set us up for continuous deployment, meaning changes made to our repository will automatically trigger re-deployment of our site, which is an advantage over using the drag-and-drop method.</p>\n<p>To be able to deploy from GitHub, we have to first make our React app available on it. Go over to GitHub and <a href=\"https://github.com/new\">create a new repository</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633593071CxggM-bL.png\" alt=\"Create a new repository page on GitHub\" /></p>\n<p>For this tutorial, we&#8217;ll name the repository “NelifyForms”. Now at the bottom of the page, click the <strong>Create Repository</strong> button and we&#8217;ll be redirected to the newly created repository page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633593091WIOFuF-L.png\" alt=\"Created new repository\" /></p>\n<p>Right now, this repository is empty. That’s because we haven&#8217;t pushed our React app to it. To do that, enter the following commands in the terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ git add *\r\n$ git commit -m 'netlify forms with stateless form'\r\n$ git remote add origin &lt;Your_repoistory's_url&gt;\r\n$ git push -u origin master\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>These commands will create a new commit, connect us to our GitHub repository, and finally push our React app over to it. </p>\n<p>Make sure to replace <strong><Your_repository’s_url></strong> with the URL of the newly created GitHub repository. Here&#8217;s an image that shows where to find the URL of the newly created repository.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633593085pvH5dTWJ.png\" alt=\"Repositories URL\" /></p>\n<p>After running the above <code>git</code> commands, refresh the browser. You&#8217;ll find that our React app has been pushed to GitHub.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633593083h0Xkn0q.png\" alt=\"NetlifyForms repository\" /></p>\n<p>Now that our React app is available on GitHub, it&#8217;s time that we deployed it on Netlify. <a href=\"https://app.netlify.com/\">Log in</a> to your Netlify account, go over to the dashboard, and click on the <strong>New site from Git</strong> button. We&#8217;ll be taken to the <a href=\"https://app.netlify.com/start\">Create a new site</a> page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633593056B9AGtwdg.png\" alt=\"Create a new site page\" /></p>\n<p>Click on the <strong>GitHub</strong> button under the <strong>Continuous Deployment</strong> section. We&#8217;re then redirected to an authorization page where Netlify will ask for access to GitHub. After giving Netlify access, we&#8217;ll see a page like the one shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633593052Aj-6heBR.png\" alt=\"Create a new site page\" /></p>\n<p>Right now, the <strong>NetlifyForms</strong> repository we created earlier is not displaying among the list of repositories, because we haven&#8217;t configured Netlify to access it yet.</p>\n<p>To do that, click on the <strong>Configure the Netlify app on GitHub</strong> link at the bottom of the page. We&#8217;ll see a page like the one shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633593094WRQnfJ4u.png\" alt=\"Configuration page for Netlify on GitHub\" /></p>\n<p>Scroll to the bottom of the page under the <strong>Repositories access</strong> section and click on the <strong>Select repositories</strong> button. We&#8217;ll see a list of our GitHub repositories.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633593088r2fCb5BE.png\" alt=\"Configuration page for Netlify on GitHub\" /></p>\n<p>Select the <strong>NelifyForms</strong> repository and then click on <strong>save</strong> to give Netlify access to this repository. After saving it, we&#8217;ll be redirected to the Create a new site page on Netlify.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633593076EfXnE8jG-1.png\" alt=\"Create a new site page on Nelify\" /></p>\n<p>Our <strong>NetlifyForms</strong> repository is now displayed in the list. Click on it and we&#8217;ll see a page like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/16335930484hVcCRR6.png\" alt=\"Site build and deployment page\" /></p>\n<p>On this page, we can set the build and deployment options for our site, like changing the Git branch to deploy from, or the command to be used to deploy our site. But there will be no need for that, because everything looks good by default.</p>\n<p>Finally, to deploy our site to Netlify, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the <strong>Deploy site</strong> button. The deployment might take a while, but once it’s done we&#8217;ll see a link to our site at the top right corner of the site dashboard page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633598323LEoAvLp.png\" alt=\"Sites URL\" /></p>\n<p>With this, our React app has been successfully deployed to Netlify from GitHub. When we click on the link, we&#8217;ll see the React form we built. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632746546rRZ1v5gF.png\" alt=\"React form\" /></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-app-contact-form-netlify-forms/?utm_source=rss\">Add a Contact Form to a React App with Netlify Forms</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

You can interact with APIs in Svelte in the <code>onMount()</code> lifecycle hook using either Axios, Apisauce, JavaScript’s native Fetch API, or any HTTP client of your choice.</strong></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll build a sample application that interacts and displays data provided by a REST API server. This application will allow users to fetch lists of blog posts from a REST API and display them on the page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>In order to follow this tutorial, you&#8217;ll need to have some prior knowledge of JavaScript and CSS, as well as some familiarity with <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/svelte-javascript-framework-introduction/\">Svelte</a>. </p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also need <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Node and npm</a> installed on your machine, as well as <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/downloads\">Git</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisarestapi\">What Is a REST API?</h2>\n<p>The acronym API stands for “application programming interface”, and in simple terms, it&#8217;s a way for two applications to communicate — or share data with each other.  </p>\n<p>A REST API is a type of API that implements the representational state transfer (REST) protocol. REST is an architectural style for building web services that interact via an HTTP protocol. The request structure of REST includes four essential parts, which are the HTTP method, an endpoint, headers, and the request body. </p>\n<h3 id=\"httpmethods\">HTTP Methods</h3>\n<p>The HTTP method in an API request tells the server what kind of action the client expects it to perform. The most widely used HTTP methods today include GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE and are explained briefly below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>GET</code>: used to fetch or read information from a server</li>\n<li><code>POST</code>: used to create or store records in a server</li>\n<li><code>PUT</code> / <code>PATCH</code>: used to update or patch records in a server</li>\n<li><code>DELETE</code>: used to delete one or more records from a resource point</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"httpendpoints\">HTTP Endpoints</h3>\n<p>An HTTP endpoint in basic terms is an address or URL that specifies where one or more resources can be accessed by an API. </p>\n<h3 id=\"httpheaders\">HTTP Headers</h3>\n<p>HTTP headers are key-value pairs that let the client pass information to the server in a request and vice-versa in a response. </p>\n<h3 id=\"requestbody\">Request Body</h3>\n<p>The body of an API call is the payload (or data) sent from the client to the server. </p>\n<h2 id=\"settingupoursvelteapp\">Setting Up our Svelte App</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll build a sample application that interacts with an external REST API to fetch a list of blog posts from a server. We&#8217;ll then display this list on the Svelte client.</p>\n<p>We’re not going to dive too much into bundling and the infrastructure of Svelte apps in this tutorial, so we’ll follow the instructions on the <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">official Svelte site</a> to get an application up and running.</p>\n<p>In your preferred directory, run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-demo-app\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, enter into the folder, install the required dependencies using npm and start a development server:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd svelte-demo-app\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run dev --open\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should now see a &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; message displayed in your browser at <a href=\"http://localhost:5000/\">http://localhost:5000/</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usingthefetchapitoconsumearestapi\">Using the Fetch API to Consume a REST API</h2>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll examine two methods of fetching data from an API. Firstly, we&#8217;ll look at using the Fetch API, which is native to JavaScript. Then in the next section we&#8217;ll look at using the Axios client, before briefly comparing and contrasting the two methods after that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatisthefetchapi\">What is the Fetch API?</h3>\n<p>The Fetch API is a promise-based mechanism that allows you to make asynchronous API requests to endpoints in JavaScript. If you’re familiar with the <code>XMLHttpRequest()</code> method, you&#8217;ll probably agree that the Fetch API is an improvement — in the sense that it provides additional features such as data caching, the ability to read streaming responses, and <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-the-fetch-api/\">more</a>.</p>\n<p>Using the Fetch API is as easy as calling the <code>fetch()</code> method with the path to the resource you’re fetching as a required parameter. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const response = fetch('your-api-url.com/endpoint');\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"passingmoreparametersinarequest\">Passing more parameters in a request</h3>\n<p>The <code>fetch()</code> method also allows you to be more specific with the request you’re making by passing an <code>init</code> object as an optional second parameter. </p>\n<p>The <code>init</code> object allows you pass extra details along with your request. The most common of these are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>method</code>: a string that specifies what HTTP method is being sent to the server and can be one of GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE. </li>\n<li><code>cache</code>: a string that specifies if the request should be cached. Allowed options are <code>default</code>, <code>no-cache</code>, <code>reload</code>, <code>force-cache</code>, <code>only-if-cached</code>.</li>\n<li><code>headers</code>: an object used to set headers to be passed along with the request example.</li>\n<li><code>body</code>: an object most commonly used in <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code> or <code>PATCH</code> requests. It allows you pass a payload to the server.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"buildingouttheappcomponent\">Building out the <code>App</code> component</h3>\n<p>Once your Svelte scaffolding has been completed, open up the <code>src</code> folder and locate the <code>App.svelte</code> component. This is what is rendered when you visit the project&#8217;s home page.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the component contains a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block for our JavaScript, a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> block for our styles, as well as a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag with our markup. This is the basic anatomy of a Svelte component.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start by importing the <code>onMount</code> hook from Svelte, like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import { onMount } from \"svelte\";\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>onMount</code> hook in Svelte is a lifecycle method used to define instructions that should be carried out once the component where it&#8217;s used is first rendered in the DOM tree. </p>\n<p>If you’re coming from a React background, you should notice that <code>onMount</code> hook in Svelte works similarly to the <code>componentDidMount()</code> method in class-based React components or the <code>useEffect()</code> hook in React functional components. </p>\n<p>Next, we’re going to define a variable to hold the URL of the endpoint we intend to use:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const endpoint = \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\";\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: <a href=\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/\">JSONPlaceholder</a> is a handy, free, online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data.</em></p>\n<p>Next, create a <code>posts</code> variable and assign an empty array to it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">let posts = [];\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This empty <code>posts</code> array is going to be filled up with the data we receive from our API once we make the call. </p>\n<p>Finally, we can now make use of the <code>onMount()</code> method to make a <code>GET</code> request to the endpoint using JavaScript’s Fetch API as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">onMount(async function () {\r\n  const response = await fetch(endpoint);\r\n  const data = await response.json();\r\n  console.log(data);\r\n});\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>When pieced together, your <code>App</code> component should contain the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">&lt;script&gt;\r\n  import { onMount } from \"svelte\";\r\n  const endpoint = \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\";\r\n  let posts = [];\r\n\r\n  onMount(async function () {\r\n    const response = await fetch(endpoint);\r\n    const data = await response.json();\r\n    console.log(data);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  export let name;\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;main&gt;\r\n  &lt;h1&gt;Hello {name}!&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=\"https://svelte.dev/tutorial\"&gt;Svelte tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to build Svelte apps.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/main&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;style&gt;\r\n  /* ommitted for brevity */\r\n&lt;/style&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>To check this is working, save the file, then visit <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/\">http://localhost:3000/</a> and check the browser&#8217;s dev tools. You should see an array of objects logged to the console.</p>\n<p><em>Note: if you&#8217;re wondering about that <code>export let name;</code> statement, this is how we define props in Svelte. The <code>export</code> keyword here declares that this value is a prop that will be provided by the component’s parent.</em></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/svelte-fetch-data/?utm_source=rss\">How to Fetch Data in Svelte</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

For this, you can use free tools like <a href=\"https://figma.com\">Figma</a> or <a href=\"https://diagrams.net\">Diagrams.net</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16309184851629922850_1093x592.png\" alt=\"Wireframe\" /></p>\n<p>Note that, in this phase, it&#8217;s not that important to think about colors and styling. What matter most is that you can structure the layout and identify the components involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"designcolors\">Design Colors</h2>\n<p>Once we&#8217;ve dealt with the layout and the components, all that will be left to do to complete the design is to pick a nice color scheme.</p>\n<p>Below are some guidelines for making the app look great:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the wrapper should contrast with the background</li>\n<li>the screen and button values should be easy to read</li>\n<li>the equals button should in a different color, to give some accent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the criteria above, we&#8217;ll use the color scheme shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16309184871629922943_1054x295.png\" alt=\"Color scheme\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"settinguptheproject\">Setting Up the Project</h2>\n<p>To start, open the terminal in your projects folder and create a boilerplate template using the <a href=\"https://create-react-app.dev/\">create-react-app</a>. To do that, run the command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx create-react-app calculator\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s the fastest and easiest way to set up a fully working React app with zero config. All you need to do after that is run <code>cd calculator</code> to switch to the newly created project folder and <code>npm start</code> to start your app in the browser.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16309184791629816928_1264x667.png\" alt=\"Browser view\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, it comes with some default boilerplate, so next we&#8217;ll do some cleaning up in the project folder tree.</p>\n<p>Find the <code>src</code> folder, where the logic of your app will live, and remove everything except <code>App.js</code> to create your app, <code>index.css</code> to style your app, and <code>index.js</code> to render your app in the DOM.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/16309184891629923847_854x288.png\" alt=\"Project tree\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"createcomponents\">Create Components</h2>\n<p>Since we&#8217;ve already done some wireframing, we already know the main building blocks of the application. Those are <code>Wrapper</code>, <code>Screen</code>, <code>ButtonBox</code>, and <code>Button</code>.</p>\n<p>First create a <code>components</code> folder inside the <code>src</code> folder. We&#8217;ll then create a separate <code>.js</code> file and <code>.css</code> file for each component.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to create those folders and files manually, you can use the following one-liner to get things set up quickly:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd src &amp;&amp; mkdir components &amp;&amp; cd components &amp;&amp; touch Wrapper.js Wrapper.css Screen.js Screen.css ButtonBox.js ButtonBox.css Button.js Button.css\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"wrapper\">Wrapper</h3>\n<p>The <code>Wrapper</code> component will be the frame, holding all the children components in place. It will also allow us to center the whole app afterward.</p>\n<h4 id=\"wrapperjs\">Wrapper.js</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import \"./Wrapper.css\";\r\n\r\nconst Wrapper = ({ children }) =&gt; {\r\n  return &lt;div className=\"wrapper\"&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Wrapper;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"wrappercss\">Wrapper.css</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.wrapper {\r\n  width: 340px;\r\n  height: 540px;\r\n  padding: 10px;\r\n  border-radius: 10px;\r\n  background-color: #485461;\r\n  background-image: linear-gradient(315deg, #485461 0%, #28313b 74%);\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"screen\">Screen</h3>\n<p>The <code>Screen</code> component will be the top section child of the <code>Wrapper</code> component, and its purpose will be to display the calculated values.</p>\n<p>In the features list, we included display output resize on length, meaning longer values must shrink in size.

It will include a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> container for our typewriter text with a class of <code>typed-out</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;!doctype html&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt;Typewriter effect&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;style&gt;\r\n      body{\r\n        background: navajowhite;\r\n        background-size: cover;\r\n        font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; \r\n      }\r\n  &lt;/style&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n  &lt;body&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=\"typed-out\"&gt;Web Developer&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"stylingthecontainerforthetypewritertext\">Styling the Container for the Typewriter Text</h2>\n<p>Now that we have the layout of the web page, let&#8217;s style the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the &#8220;typed-out&#8221; class:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.typed-out {\r\n  overflow: hidden;\r\n  border-right: .15em solid orange;\r\n  font-size: 1.6rem;\r\n  width: 0;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that, in order for the typewriter effect to work, we&#8217;ve added the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>\"overflow: hidden;\"</code> and a <code>\"width: 0;\"</code>, to make sure the text content isn&#8217;t revealed until the typing effect has started.</li>\n<li><code>\"border-right: .15em solid orange;\"</code>, to create the typewriter cursor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before making the typing effect, in order to stop the cursor at the last letter of the <code>typed-out</code> element once it has been fully typed out, the way a typewriter (or really a word processor) would, we&#8217;ll create a container for the <code>typed-out</code> element and add <code>display: inline-block;</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.container {\r\n  display: inline-block;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"makingtherevealtextanimation\">Making the Reveal-text Animation</h2>\n<p>The typewriter animation is going to create the effect of the text inside the <code>typed-out</code> element being typed out, letter by letter. We&#8217;ll use the <code>@keyframes</code> CSS animation rule:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">@keyframes typing {\r\n  from { width: 0 }\r\n  to { width: 100% }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, all this animation does is change an element&#8217;s width from 0 to 100%.</p>\n<p>Now, we&#8217;ll include this animation in our <code>typed-out</code> class and set its animation direction to <code>forwards</code> to make sure the text element won&#8217;t go back to <code>width: 0</code> after the animation has finished:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.typed-out{\r\n    overflow: hidden;\r\n    border-right: .15em solid orange;\r\n    white-space: nowrap;\r\n    font-size: 1.6rem;\r\n    width: 0;\r\n    animation: typing 1s forwards;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Our text element will simply be revealed in one smooth step, from left to right:</p>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-slug-hash=\"OJjLXqE\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n<span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/OJjLXqE\"><br />\nSmooth step</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br />\non <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p><script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script><br />\n<!-- https://codepen.io/matveynikon/pen/OJggJGG  --></p>\n<h2 id=\"addingstepstoachieveatypewritereffect\">Adding Steps to Achieve a Typewriter Effect</h2>\n<p>So far, our text is revealed, but in a smooth way that doesn&#8217;t reveal the text letter by letter. This is a start, but obviously it&#8217;s not what a typewriter effect looks like. </p>\n<p>To make this animation reveal our text element letter by letter, or <strong>in steps</strong>, the way a typewriter would, we need to split the <code>typing</code> animation included by the <code>typed-out</code> class into steps in order for it to look like it&#8217;s being typed out. This is where the <code>steps()</code> CSS function comes in:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.typed-out{\r\n  overflow: hidden;\r\n  border-right: .15em solid orange;\r\n  white-space: nowrap;\r\n  font-size: 1.6rem;\r\n  width: 0;\r\n  animation: \r\n    typing 1s steps(20, end) forwards;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, we&#8217;ve split the <code>typing</code> animation into 20 steps using the CSS <code>steps()</code> function. This is what we see now:</p>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-slug-hash=\"XWarjrX\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n<span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/XWarjrX\"><br />\nMultiple steps</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br />\non <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p><script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script><br />\n<!-- https://codepen.io/matveynikon/pen/oNwwgNd --></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s our full code so far:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;html&gt;\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt;Typewriter effect&lt;/title&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n  &lt;style&gt;\r\n    body{\r\n      background: navajowhite;\r\n      background-size: cover;\r\n      font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; \r\n    }\r\n    .container{\r\n      display: inline-block;\r\n    }\r\n    .typed-out{\r\n      overflow: hidden;\r\n      border-right: .15em solid orange;\r\n      white-space: nowrap;\r\n      animation: \r\n      typing 1s steps(20, end) forwards;\r\n      font-size: 1.6rem;\r\n      width: 0;\r\n    }\r\n    @keyframes typing {\r\n      from { width: 0 }\r\n      to { width: 100% }\r\n    }\r\n  &lt;/style&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;I'm Matt, I'm a&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=\"typed-out\"&gt;Web Developer&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/css-typewriter-effect/?utm_source=rss\">How to Create a CSS Typewriter Effect for your Website</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

You need to get yourself to a place where you acknowledge that there is a problem.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, it is similar to white people having a problem with the \"black lives matter\" message and insisting on using a \"black lives matter too\" or \"all lives matter\" instead.. of course they do! but the original phrase is to help raise awareness of the particular problem and I can completely understand why variations on it detract from the original message/problem. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-is-it-so-offensive-to-say-all-lives-matter-153188\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>For me the most important thing that men can do is admit there is a problem and after that, as I've listed, there are various ways to help to get towards a place where women are treated equally in tech. (I don't have all the answers before someone asks me how we get there).</p>\n\n<p>Slightly selfishly as I write this I realise that I am thinking about the world I want my 8yo daughter to live in and my 5yo son to be aware of and help towards creating. </p>\n\n<p>What kind of future do you want future generations to live in?</p>\n\n<p>-- Lee</p>\n\n<p>(Photo by Elena Mozhvilo, from Unsplash)</p>\n\n"

SEOquake</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seoquake/akdgnmcogleenhbclghghlkkdndkjdjc?hl=en\">SEOquake</a> is an extension created by Semrush that can be used to keep track of how a website is doing when it comes to SEO.</p>\n<p>This extension allows you to quickly check things like domain authority (DA), monthly visits, pages/visit, average visit duration, bounce rate, Alexa rank, and even a website’s Whois record right from the search engine result pages (SERPs).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627786344SEOquake.png\" alt=\"SEOquake SERPs stats\" /></p>\n<p>You can also click the SEOquake icon on your browser toolbar to access other features like page SEO audit, keyword density, internal and external links, and URLs/domains comparison.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627786341SEOquake-Page-SEO-Audit.jpg\" alt=\"Page SEO Audit by SEOquake\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Page SEO Audit</strong>. Allows you to check URL characters, title tags, meta descriptions and keywords, mobile accessibility, XML sitemaps, <code>robots.txt</code>, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Keyword density</strong>. Displays all the keywords mentioned in a specific blog post.</li>\n<li><strong>Internal and external links</strong>. Checks each link on a given page and shows the anchor text and parameters associated with it.</li>\n<li><strong>Compare URLs/domains</strong>. Allows you to compare your URL with your competitors&#8217; URLs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2linkcheckerbylrt\">2. Link Checker by LRT</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/free-backlink-checker-by/nifeadedgedikheglfngocdgfidiiimi\">Link Checker</a> by LRT is a powerful SEO extension you can use to check and analyze all the links on a web page. However, despite its name, this tool doesn’t actually check inbound links, but only outbound ones.</p>\n<p>Link Checker will highlight good links in green, unverified links in yellow, and broken links in red. You can also see the number of follow, nofollow, verified, and unverified links from the same root domain, internal, and external.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627786496Backlink-Checker-by-LRT.jpg\" alt=\"Link Checker by LRT\" /></p>\n<p>Another cool feature is that it allows you to see the source code by hovering over a link instead of right-clicking and opening the Inspect Element tool.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627786319Checking-Source-Code-on-Hover-Browser-Extension.png\" alt=\"Source code window\" /></p>\n<p>This SEO extension can be extremely useful for those using <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/guest-blogging/\">guest posting</a> or Help a Reporter Out (HARO) as part of their <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/ultimate-guide-link-building-content/\">link-building</a> strategy. When sending HARO pitches and publishing guest posts, you can quickly check whether or not they included your link and if they followed or nofollowed it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3hunter\">3. Hunter</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hunter.io/chrome\">Hunter</a> is another great extension for those doing guest posting or active link-building outreach for SEO. </p>\n<p>This extension will <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/web-scraping-for-beginners/\">scrape the website</a> you’re browsing and find all the email addresses associated with it. For some contacts, you also get to see their position in the company. The free account of Hunter allows up to 50 free searches per month.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627786323Hunter-IO-Browser-Extension-SC-min.png\" alt=\"Email list gathered by Hunter extension\" /></p>\n<p>If you’re looking for someone specific, you can find them by adding their first and last name to the search bar (it has to be both for it to work).</p>\n<p>This is a great way to send pitches to websites that might accept guest posts but don’t have a dedicated “write for us” page. </p>\n<p>Instead of pitching to a generic support email address, you can search and pitch to the editor, content manager, or even the CEO if it’s a smaller company.</p>\n<p>If Hunter doesn’t find any names or shows their position, you can search for the company on LinkedIn and look under the “People” tab to find a list of their employees. Then, simply go back to Hunter and input their name to find their email address.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, when pitching to publications that don’t publicly advertise a “write for us” page or might have never accepted guest posts before, it’s even more important to make your pitch quick, persuasive, and polite.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t the best at writing compelling copy, you can use an <a href=\"https://blogstalgia.com/ai-writing-software/\">AI copywriting tool</a> to do it for you.</p>\n<p>Below is pictured a guest post pitch generated by Jarvis AI.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627786321Guest-Post-Pitch-Generated-by-Jarvis-AI.jpg\" alt=\"Guest post pitch generated by Jarvis AI\" /></p>\n<p>The last thing you want is to annoy them and have your email labeled as spam. </p>\n<h2 id=\"4pagespeedinsights\">4. PageSpeed Insights</h2>\n<p>We live in an era of instant gratification, so it’s no surprise that most people won’t wait around for a website that takes <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/increase-speed-of-your-mobile-site-wi/\">more than three seconds</a> to load.</p>\n<p>Website speed has become a ranking factor for major search engines as of late, as evidenced by Google’s recent <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience\">page experience update</a> that takes into account a set of metrics related to speed, responsiveness, and visual stability called Core Web Vitals.</p>\n<p>If you’re working on <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/speed-wordpress/\">speed optimization</a>, it can be time-consuming to copy and paste your site to test its speed after every little tweak. With a free browser extension like <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pagespeed-insights-with-p/lanlbpjbalfkflkhegagflkgcfklnbnh?hl=en\">PageSpeed Insights</a> (PSI), you can just click the icon and have it redirect you to the PSI website and automatically run the test, or use PSI inside Chrome&#8217;s DevTools.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627786335PageSpeed-Insights-Browser-Extension.jpg\" alt=\"PageSpeed Insights\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"5seosearchsimulator\">5. SEO Search Simulator</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seo-search-simulator-by-n/edfjfgjklednkencfhnokmkajbgfhpon?hl=en\">SEO Search Simulator</a> by Nightwatch simulates Google searches from anywhere in the world and allows you to track a website’s ranking position in SERPs.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of the keyword “best markdown editor for iOS” in Canada. Once we add the URL of the website we want to find, in this case, “sitepoint.com,” it&#8217;ll show its position for this particular keyword inside the green square.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1627786338SEO-Search-Simulator-Browser-Extension-Example.png\" alt=\"Search Simulator\" /></p>\n<p>You can then click the square to jump to the listing. This browser extension can also be used to see how well your competitors are ranking for a particular keyword.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/free-seo-browser-extensions/?utm_source=rss\">10 Free Browser Extensions for a More Efficient SEO Workflow</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Little touches like the little shape dudes that walk around the screen (but otherwise don&#8217;t do anything) give it a lot of character. I kinda want little shape dudes that walk around on websites. But another UI choice caught my eye, the way that transitions between screens have these diagonal lines that grow and fill the screen, like window blinds closing, kinda.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-357109\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick screencast showing how those wipes work:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"cleanshot-2021-11-21-at-07-24-28-1-mp4\" width='500' height='298' src='https://videopress.com/embed/PSfEu8ty?cover=1&amp;preloadContent=metadata&amp;hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent=\"true\" ></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1633526814'></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to have a crack at building this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing that went through my mind is <code>repeating-linear-gradient</code> and how that can be <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-gradients/#repeating-gradients\">used to build stripes</a>. So say we set up like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.gradient {\n  background-image:\n    repeating-linear-gradient(\n      45deg,\n      #ff8a00,\n      #ff8a00 10px,\n      #e52e71 10px,\n      #e52e71 20px\n    );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That would buy us stripes like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"351\" height=\"241\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-22-at-6.58.31-AM.png?resize=351%2C241&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-357450\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-22-at-6.58.31-AM.png?w=351&amp;ssl=1 351w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-22-at-6.58.31-AM.png?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We can use <code>transparent</code> as a color though. Meaning if we covered the screen with stripes like these, we could see through where that color is. Say like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_oNeRRMq\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/oNeRRMq?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=oNeRRMq&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed oNeRRMq\" title=\"CodePen Embed oNeRRMq\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In that gradient definition, we use <code>10px</code> as the &#8220;start&#8221; and <code>20px</code> as the &#8220;end&#8221; of the gradient before it repeats. Part of the trick here is keeping that <code>20px</code> &#8220;end&#8221; the same and animating the &#8220;start&#8221; number up to it. When we do that, it actually covers the screen in a solid color. The problem is&#8230; how do you animate it? You can&#8217;t do this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"826\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cant-animate-1.png?resize=826%2C652&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of a CSS code snippet on a dark gray background with syntax highlighting. An arrow is pointing from the repeating linear gradient on the element to another repeating linear gradient inside keyframes. A note that says not going to animate is displayed in large white letters above a crying emoji.\" class=\"wp-image-357688\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cant-animate-1.png?w=826&amp;ssl=1 826w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cant-animate-1.png?resize=300%2C237&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cant-animate-1.png?resize=768%2C606&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What we need to do is animate that &#8220;start&#8221; pixel value number alone. We can use <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/\">a custom property</a>, but it&#8217;s a little tricky because without declaring them, custom properties are just strings, and not animatable lengths. So we&#8217;d have to do it like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@property --start {\n  syntax: \"&lt;length>\";\n  inherits: false;\n  initial-value: 10px;\n}\n#cover {\n  position: fixed;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(\n    45deg,\n    #ff8a00,\n    #ff8a00 var(--start),\n    transparent var(--start),\n    transparent var(--end, 20px)\n  );\n  animation: cover 1s linear infinite;\n}\n@keyframes cover {\n  to {\n    --start: 20px;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got to <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/#property\">use <code>@property</code></a> here to do this, which I really like but, sadly, <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_property\">has limited browser support</a>. It does work though! I&#8217;ve got all that set up, including a quick <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/\"><code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query</a>. I&#8217;m using a smidge of JavaScript to change the background halfway through the animation (while the screen is covered) so you can see how it might be used for a screen transition. Again, note that this is only working in Chromium-based browsers at the moment:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_oNePEyW\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/oNePEyW?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=oNePEyW&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed oNePEyW\" title=\"CodePen Embed oNePEyW\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice I&#8217;ve used CSS custom properties for other things as well, like the angle and size of the stripes and the speed of the animation. They are both very trivial to change! I&#8217;ve chucked in <a href=\"https://github.com/yairEO/knobs\">knobs</a> so you can adjust things to your liking. Knobs? Yeah, they are cool:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Knobs!\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/09qdFxIlT7o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Like and subscribe</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This whole thing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1459169558888128512\">started as a tweet</a>. In this case, I&#8217;m glad I did as Temani Afif chimed in with a way to do it with <code>mask</code>s as well, meaning pretty solid support across all browsers:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_jOLvdGX\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/jOLvdGX?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=jOLvdGX&amp;default-tab=css,result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed jOLvdGX\" title=\"CodePen Embed jOLvdGX\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think animating background color stops or a mask position is particularly performant, but since we&#8217;re talking &#8220;screen wipes&#8221; here, one could imagine that the page isn&#8217;t likely to be interacted with anymore until the page transition is over, so maybe that&#8217;s not the world&#8217;s biggest deal.</p>\n"

They do <em>less</em> work, but it seems like they&#8217;re receiving more and <em>more</em> rewards. You&#8217;re running circles around the slackers on your team, but your manager doesn&#8217;t seem to care.</p>\n<p>How is this fair?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s completely <em>unfair</em>. What&#8217;s worse, this scenario will continue to repeat itself whether you stay in your current role or not.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isyourmanageraterribleperson\">Is Your Manager a Terrible Person?</h2>\n<p>Your manager (or boss) is a terrible person. Or at least, that&#8217;s the nagging thought many developers have as they notice their peers are passing them by.</p>\n<p>Is it true?</p>\n<p>Possibly, but that answer isn&#8217;t something you can fix. If your boss is a terrible person, there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it. You can&#8217;t <em>force</em> them to change.</p>\n<p>But what if you could <em>persuade</em> them to change?</p>\n<p>Well, that would be something now, wouldn&#8217;t it? Well, you <em>can</em> change their mind if you understand why they&#8217;re not rewarding you for your hard work. Worst case scenario, you&#8217;ll know whether it&#8217;s time to find another job or not.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s look now at five reasons managers refuse to give developers the rewards they deserve, and what you can do about it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reason1youareinsuranceforthefuture\">Reason 1: You Are Insurance for the Future</h2>\n<p>Your manager may be making moves towards a promotion or change in position. They view you as a necessary component to <em>his success</em>, and they want you with them as they climb the corporate ladder.</p>\n<p>When they&#8217;re promoted, you&#8217;re promoted.</p>\n<p>In their mind, this is great for job security because it means they see you as invaluable. Unfortunately, this means they&#8217;re not going to let you out of their sight if they can help it.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a tough position to be in.</p>\n<p>If you call your boss out on this, there&#8217;s a very good chance they&#8217;ll fire you or punish you in some way. If you know you&#8217;re able to have a heart-to-heart with your boss and it will be received well, go for it.</p>\n<p>What if it won&#8217;t?</p>\n<p>There are two ways to approach the problem. The easiest option is to simply find another job.</p>\n<p>What if you can&#8217;t quit your job?</p>\n<p>The second option is to begin building connections and allies in your company. If you can move laterally to another position or role in your current company, it would be good to do so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reason2theycantaffordtorewardyou\">Reason 2: They Can&#8217;t Afford to Reward You</h2>\n<p>This is a common problem.</p>\n<p>Your manager has a specific budget to work with. This budget is typically set in stone until it&#8217;s time to renegotiate the budget for the next fiscal year. For whatever reason, a raise for you and your colleagues would put their department over budget.</p>\n<p><em>Your boss can&#8217;t say that, of course.</em></p>\n<p>If they decide to tell you the truth — that they can&#8217;t afford to give you a raise — you and your co-workers will leave.</p>\n<p><em>Your manager can&#8217;t have that.</em></p>\n<p>So they&#8217;ll string you along for as long as they can, until they can actually give you a substantial raise. Your manager can string you along in several ways. For example, they can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>give you a cost of living raise (3% or less), which is kind of an insult</li>\n<li>give you cheaper amenities (that is, a promise to increase 401k contributions in the future) to placate you while they work with HR to figure out how much they can give you</li>\n<li>give you nothing because you&#8217;re a patriot, and you&#8217;ll stay even if you receive nothing (more on that in a minute)</li>\n<li>push you out of the company once they&#8217;ve squeezed as much value out of you as they can (they had no intention of increasing your pay and will dump you when confronted)</li>\n<li>give someone else a (cheaper) raise in hopes that you&#8217;ll accept the same when word gets out or you&#8217;ll leave</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of the time, your manager will never admit they can&#8217;t afford to reward you.</p>\n<p>How will they respond?</p>\n<p>It all depends on whether you&#8217;re a patriot or a mercenary.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/157676/employees-either-patriots-mercenaries.aspx\">Gallup</a> and Steve Rasmussen, former CEO at Nationwide, all employees are either “patriots” or “mercenaries”.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Patriots</strong> identify with their company. They&#8217;ve bought into the company&#8217;s values and culture. They&#8217;ve embraced the company mission, and they&#8217;re true believers. They&#8217;re in it for the long haul. They&#8217;re working in support of something bigger than themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mercenaries</strong> are more likely to focus on personal outcomes. They&#8217;re great at getting results, but they&#8217;re typically more disengaged. They&#8217;re gone as soon as things take a turn for the worse. They&#8217;re phenomenal workers, but they&#8217;re hired guns.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a patriot, managers will likely blow you off for as long as they can. They know you&#8217;re a committed employee, so there&#8217;s less incentive to do what&#8217;s necessary to keep you.</p>\n<p>They know you aren&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a mercenary, you&#8217;re focused on <strong>wiifm</strong> (what&#8217;s in it for me?). If you&#8217;re a superstar employee but also a mercenary, management will work harder to keep you, so long as you continue to perform. The lack of loyalty goes both ways. If you&#8217;re a mediocre or terrible employee, management will simply let you go.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/managers-developers-rewards/?utm_source=rss\">5 Reasons Managers Refuse to Give Developers the Rewards They Deserve</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

All this code needs to be tested, debugged and maintained during the entire lifetime of the project. This takes a lot of time that developers can be using to develop new features. In this article, you&#8217;ll learn how Hasura and PostgreSQL can help you speed up app development and launch backends quickly with minimal effort.</strong></p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/\">Hasura</a> is an open-source GraphQL engine that generates GraphQL and REST API endpoints using your database schema. It supports data modeling, real-time querying, event programming, role-based authorization and actions for running custom business logic over GraphQL.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a> is a popular and powerful open-source, object-oriented relational database that offers enterprise-class features on a similar level with Oracle Database and Microsoft SQL Server. PostgreSQL is used by large international companies such as Netflix, Instagram, Uber and Spotify, according to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stackshare.io/postgresql\">StackShare</a>.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll go over the main features Hasura provides that makes it suitable for developing and launching scalable backends, for both web and mobile applications. We&#8217;ll also look at how you can leverage PostgreSQL&#8217;s features to perform various computation and analytical tasks using just SQL to deliver the right data to your frontend without writing custom code.</p>\n<p>Do note that Hasura does support other databases as well, such as Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Aurora and Google BigQuery. We&#8217;ll focus on PostgreSQL, since it&#8217;s free and accessible for the majority of businesses and organizations. Support for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/graphql/database/mysql/\">MySQL</a> is coming soon, in case you&#8217;re interested.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to GraphQL, please check out our <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-a-web-app-with-graphql-and-react/\">tutorial</a> to learn more. Let&#8217;s start with why PostgreSQL can be a perfect choice for your project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whypostgresql\">Why PostgreSQL</h2>\n<p>Relational databases have many distinct advantages over other types of databases, in that you can model your data using strict schemas and table relationships. The ability to perform JOINs and execute ACID transactions is a major requirement for many applications in most industries. These features are essential to promoting integrity and consistency of business data at any given time.</p>\n<p>PostgreSQL also has additional advantages over other relational databases such as MySQL, in that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can model data using <strong>table inheritance</strong></li>\n<li>it has better <strong>concurrency control</strong> for multi-user environments (you can write massive amounts of data more efficiently)</li>\n<li>it&#8217;s <strong>fault tolerant</strong> and is less prone to data corruption</li>\n<li>it supports a number unique data types such as <strong>JSON</strong> and <strong>Spatial</strong>, which is useful for finance and research-related applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PostgreSQL isn&#8217;t just a data storage service. It&#8217;s also a server capable of running custom functions and triggers to perform various computation and analytical tasks. Running logic on PostgreSQL is more efficient, as it negates the need to write custom server code. You can define logic in PostgreSQL using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Views</strong>, a stored query that can help simplify complex queries</li>\n<li><strong>Functions &#038; Operators</strong>, such as date formatting, pattern matching, arithmetic operations</li>\n<li><strong>Extensions</strong>, addons that extends PostgreSQL&#8217;s capabilities (such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://postgis.net/\">PostGIS</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Procedural Languages</strong>, programming languages for writing user-defined functions, stored procedures, triggers and extending the standard SQL (such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/plpgsql-overview.html\">PL/pgSQL</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you implement logic in PostgreSQL, Hasura is able to expose them to frontend applications via GraphQL queries and mutations. Here&#8217;s a top-level view of a PostgreSQL server, as seen via the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pgadmin.org/\">pgAdmin</a> interface:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/163653365901-pgAdmin-interface.png\" alt=\"The pgAdmin interface\" /></p>\n<p>Learning to take advantage of PostgreSQL features can help you solve complex problems easily without writing server code. Here are a few examples of what you can do with PostgreSQL:</p>\n<h3 id=\"example1\">EXAMPLE 1</h3>\n<p>You can retrieve a list of online users that are currently active using a <strong>view</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"sql language-sql\">CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW \"public\".\"online_users\" AS\r\n SELECT users.id,\r\n    users.last_seen\r\n   FROM users\r\n  WHERE (users.last_seen &gt;= (now() - '00:00:30'::interval));\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"example2\">EXAMPLE 2</h3>\n<p>Using a <strong>PostGIS function</strong>, you can list all stores that are located within a 1,000 meter radius. See this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.compose.com/articles/geofile-everything-in-the-radius-with-postgis/\">geolocation tutorial</a> for a detailed explanation:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"sql language-sql\">SELECT id, name, address, geom\r\nFROM Seattle_Starbucks\r\nWHERE ST_DWithin(geom, ST_MakePoint(-122.325959,47.625138)::geography, 1000);\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the next section, we&#8217;ll focus on Hasura&#8217;s features.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatishasura\">What is Hasura?</h2>\n<p>Hasura is an open-source, real-time GraphQL engine that generates GraphQL and REST API endpoints for your database. It comes with a web console that allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>model your database schema</li>\n<li>view, insert, update and delete data</li>\n<li>implement role-based access control policies</li>\n<li>run GraphQL queries and mutations</li>\n<li>create REST endpoints</li>\n<li>run SQL code</li>\n<li>define actions and triggers</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/163653366302-hasura-api-dashboard.png\" alt=\"Hasura API dashboard\" /></p>\n<p>Hasura doesn&#8217;t support user authentication, so you&#8217;ll need to integrate Hasura and your frontend application with a provider such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.clerk.dev/integrations/hasura\">Clerk</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/guides/integrations/auth0-jwt.html\">Auth0</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/blog/add-5-login-methods-to-your-hasura-app-in-5-minutes-with-onegraphs-authguardian/\">AuthGuardian</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/blog/authentication-and-authorization-using-hasura-and-firebase/\">Firebase</a></li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/blog/how-to-build-a-simple-secure-social-media-site-with-magic-and-hasura/\">Magic</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s also no file storage service, you&#8217;ll need to integrate your app with a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/blog/building-file-upload-downloads-for-your-hasura-app/\">third-party storage provider</a>. If you’d prefer a more out-of-the-box integrated experience with Hasura, you can check out <strong>NHost</strong>, which we&#8217;ll discuss later in the deployment section.</p>\n<p>In the next section, we&#8217;ll look at how we can run Hasura locally and in the cloud.</p>\n<h2 id=\"launchinghasura\">Launching Hasura</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of ways you can quickly launch and run a Hasura instance:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1docker\">1. Docker</h3>\n<p>Using Docker to run Hasura in your local machine is the recommended way for setting up a development environment. With this setup, there&#8217;s no rate limiting for API requests and there&#8217;s no internet connection throttling your experience when you interact with Hasura&#8217;s web console. Any work you do locally can easily be migrated to staging and production environments. We&#8217;ll discuss how this is done later in the &#8220;Migrations and Environments&#8221; section.</p>\n<p>Assuming you already have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/\">Docker</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/\">Docker Compose</a> already installed on your machine, you can follow the instructions provided by this <a href=\"https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/getting-started/docker-simple.html\">guide</a> to run Hasura on your machine:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># create new directory\r\nmkdir my-hasura\r\ncd my-hasura\r\n\r\n# download docker-compose.yml\r\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yml\r\n\r\n# start hasura and postgresql container instances\r\ndocker-compose up -d\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can confirm your Hasura and PostgreSQL container instances are running by executing the command <code>docker ps</code>. You should be able to access your local Hasura instance via your browser at <code>http://localhost:8080/console</code>. To complete the setup, you&#8217;ll need to connect to the PostgreSQL database, which is running as a container alongside Hasura&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>With the database connected, you&#8217;ll be able to use the web console to create tables, define relationships and perform CRUD operations on your data. Do note that your data is public when using the default Docker setup. You can secure it by simply uncommenting the line that starts with <code>HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET</code> in your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and restarting your Hasura container.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2cloud\">2. Cloud</h3>\n<p>A much easier way of getting started is via <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/cloud/\">Hasura Cloud</a>. This is a re-engineered version of the open-source Hasura designed for scalability, availability, security<br />\nand global distribution.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/163653366503-hasura-cloud-dashboard.png\" alt=\"The Hasura Cloud dashboard\" /></p>\n<p>Hasura Cloud comes with several new features not available in the open-source version, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/graphql/monitoring/\">Monitoring dashboard</a> for errors, connections, subscriptions, slow queries and other operations</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/graphql/caching/\">GraphQL caching</a> for improved server and client data fetching performance</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/cloud/security/api-limits.html\">Rate limiting</a> for preventing malicious users and DDoS attacks from compromising your API</li>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/cloud/regression-tests.html\">Regression testing</a> for running test suites such as checking changes in your dev instance against your production instance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get started with Hasura Cloud, you&#8217;ll need to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/\">sign up</a> for a free account. Do note the free account has a rate limit of 60 requests per minute. After creating an account, you&#8217;ll need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a project (a Hasura instance)</li>\n<li>Connect to a PostgreSQL database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For convenience, Hasura Cloud provides a one-click installation and connection to a free Heroku Cloud database instance. You can also connect to any other PostgreSQL database that&#8217;s accessible over the Internet. There are many PostgreSQL providers you can use. These include cloud services such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS</li>\n<li>Azure</li>\n<li>Digital Ocean</li>\n<li>TimescaleDB Cloud</li>\n<li>YugabyteDB</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can follow this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/cloud/getting-started/index.html\">guide</a> if you need more clarity with the steps above. By default, Hasura Cloud restricts data access from the public using the admin secret key. We&#8217;ll discuss more about this in the upcoming sections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hasurafeatures\">Hasura Features</h2>\n<p>In this section, I&#8217;ll give you a high-level overview of the features that Hasura offers for building a custom backend without writing code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"datamanager\">Data Manager</h3>\n<p>Hasura comes with a visual designer for modeling your data layer. This allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create tables</li>\n<li>define relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)</li>\n<li>perform CRUD operations</li>\n<li>create views</li>\n<li>run any SQL statement</li>\n<li>implement data validation using PostgreSQL&#8217;s DDL constraints</li>\n<li>define triggers</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/163653366904-hasura-create-table.png\" alt=\"Hasura create table\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes to columns, Hasura supports a rich set of data types which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>integers, numerics and floats</li>\n<li>serials and UUID</li>\n<li>characters and text</li>\n<li>date and time</li>\n<li>Boolean</li>\n<li>geometric — such as line, box, path, polygon and circle</li>\n<li>JSON</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also add custom types using the <code>CREATE TYPE</code> SQL command. Next, we&#8217;ll look at how data is authorized in Hasura.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/hasura-postgresql-build-backend/?utm_source=rss\">How to Build Your Backend with Hasura and PostgreSQL</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

If you&#8217;ve ever found yourself repeating the same snippet of code all throughout your React app, you&#8217;ve come to the right article.</strong></p>\n<p>In this tutorial, you&#8217;ll be introduced to the three most common indicators that it&#8217;s time to build a reusable React component. Then we&#8217;ll go on to look at some practical demos by building a reusable layout and two exciting React hooks. </p>\n<p>By the time you&#8217;ve finished reading, you&#8217;ll be able to figure out by yourself <em>when</em> it&#8217;s appropriate to create reusable React components, and <em>how</em> to do so.</p>\n<p>This article assumes a basic knowledge of React and React hooks. If you want to brush up on these topics, I recommend you to check out “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-react-beginners-guide/\">Getting Started with React</a>” guide and “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-hooks/\">Intorduction to React Hooks</a>”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"topthreeindicatorsofareusablereactcomponent\">Top Three Indicators of a Reusable React Component</h2>\n<p>First let&#8217;s look at some indications of <em>when</em> you might want to do this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"repetitivecreationofwrapperswiththesamecssstyle\">Repetitive creation of wrappers with the same CSS style</h3>\n<p>My favorite sign of knowing when to create a reusable component is the repetitive use of the same CSS style. Now, you may think, &#8220;Wait a minute: why don&#8217;t I simply assign the same class name to elements that share the same CSS style?&#8221; You&#8217;re absolutely right. It&#8217;s not a good idea to create reusable components every time some elements in different components share the same style. In fact, it may introduce unnecessary complexity. So you have to ask yourself one more thing: are these commonly styled elements <em>wrappers</em>?</p>\n<p>For example, consider the following login and signup pages:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// Login.js\r\nimport './common.css';\r\n\r\nfunction Login() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div className='wrapper'&gt;\r\n      &lt;main&gt;\r\n        {...}\r\n      &lt;/main&gt;\r\n      &lt;footer className='footer'&gt;\r\n        {...}\r\n      &lt;/footer&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// SignUp.js\r\nimport './common.css';\r\n\r\nfunction Signup() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div className='wrapper'&gt;\r\n      &lt;main&gt;\r\n        {...}\r\n      &lt;/main&gt;\r\n      &lt;footer className='footer'&gt;\r\n        {...}\r\n      &lt;/footer&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The same styles are being applied to the container (the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element) and the footer of each component. So in this case, you can create two reusable components — <code>&lt;Wrapper /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Footer /&gt;</code> —  and pass them children as a prop. For example, the login component could be refactored as follows: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// Login.js\r\nimport Footer from \"./Footer.js\";\r\n\r\nfunction Login() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Wrapper main={{...}} footer={&lt;Footer /&gt;} /&gt;\r\n  );\r\n} \r\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a result, you no longer need to import <code>common.css</code> in multiple pages or create the same <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements to wrap everything. </p>\n<h3 id=\"repetitiveuseofeventlisteners\">Repetitive use of event listeners</h3>\n<p>To attach an event listener to an element, you can either handle it inside <code>useEffect()</code> like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// App.js\r\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const handleKeydown = () =&gt; {\r\n    alert('key is pressed.');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeydown);\r\n    return () =&gt; {\r\n      document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeydown);\r\n    }\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  return (...);\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you can do it directly inside your JSX like this, as is demonstrated in the following button component:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// Button.js\r\nfunction Button() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;button type=\"button\" onClick={() =&gt; { alert('Hi!')}}&gt;\r\n      Click me!\r\n    &lt;/button&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you want to add an event listener to <code>document</code> or <code>window</code>, you&#8217;d have to go with the first method. However, as you may have already realized, the first method requires more code with the use of <code>useEffect()</code>, <code>addEventListener()</code> and <code>removeEventListener()</code>. So in such case, creating a custom hook will allow your components to be more concise. </p>\n<p>There are four possible scenarios for using event listeners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>same event listener, same event handler</li>\n<li>same event listener, different event handler</li>\n<li>different event listener, same event handler</li>\n<li>different event listener, different event handler</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the first scenario, you can create a hook where both the event listener and the event handler are defined. Consider the following hook:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// useEventListener.js\r\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport default function useKeydown() {\r\n  const handleKeydown = () =&gt; {\r\n    alert('key is pressed.');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeydown);\r\n    return () =&gt; {\r\n      document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeydown);\r\n    }\r\n  }, []);\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can then use this hook in any component as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// App.js\r\nimport useKeydown from './useKeydown.js';\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  useKeydown();\r\n  return (...);\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>For the other three scenarios, I recommend creating a hook that receives an event and an event handling function as props. For example, I will pass <code>keydown</code> and <code>handleKeydown</code> as props to my custom hook. Consider the following hook:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// useEventListener.js\r\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport default function useEventListener({ event, handler} ) {\r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    document.addEventListener(event, props.handler);\r\n    return () =&gt; {\r\n      document.removeEventListener(event, props.handler);\r\n    }\r\n  }, []);\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can then employ this hook in any component as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// App.js\r\nimport useEventListener from './useEventListener.js';\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  const handleKeydown = () =&gt; {\r\n    alert('key is pressed.');\r\n  }\r\n  useEventListener('keydown', handleKeydown);\r\n  return (...);\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"repetitiveuseofthesamegraphqlscript\">Repetitive use of the same GraphQL script</h3>\n<p>You don&#8217;t really need to look for signs when it comes to making GraphQL code reusable. For complex applications, GraphQL scripts for a query or a mutation easily take up 30–50 lines of code because there are many attributes to request. If you&#8217;re using the same GraphQL script more than once or twice, I think it deserves its own custom hook. </p>\n<p>Consider the following example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">import { gql, useQuery } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\r\n\r\nconst GET_POSTS = gql`\r\n  query getPosts {\r\n    getPosts {\r\n    user {\r\n      id\r\n      name\r\n      ...\r\n      }\r\n      emojis {\r\n         id\r\n         ...\r\n      }\r\n      ...\r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n\r\nconst { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_POSTS, {\r\n  fetchPolicy: \"network-only\"\r\n});\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead of repeating this code in every page that requests posts from the back end, you should create a React hook for this particular API:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">import { gql, useQuery } from \"@apollo/react-hooks\";\r\n\r\nfunction useGetPosts() {\r\n  const GET_POSTS = gql`{...}`;\r\n  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_POSTS, {\r\n    fetchPolicy: \"network-only\"\r\n  });\r\n  return [data];\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Test = () =&gt; {\r\n  const [data] = useGetPosts();\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div&gt;{data?.map(post =&gt; &lt;h1&gt;{post.text}&lt;/h1&gt;)}&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"buildingoutthreereusablereactcomponents\">Building Out Three Reusable React Components</h2>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve seen some common signs of <em>when</em> to create a new component that you can share throughout your react application, let&#8217;s put that knowledge into practice and build out three practical demos.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1layoutcomponent\">1. Layout component</h3>\n<p>React is normally used for building complex web apps. This means that a large number of pages need to be developed in React, and I doubt that every page of an app will have a different layout. For instance, a web app consisting of 30 pages usually uses less than five different layouts. Therefore, building a flexible, reusable layout that can be utilized in many different pages is essential. This will save you very many lines of code and consequently a tremendous amount of time.</p>\n<p>Consider the following React functional component:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// Feed.js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport style from \"./Feed.module.css\";\r\n\r\nexport default function Feed() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div className={style.FeedContainer}&gt;\r\n      &lt;header className={style.FeedHeader}&gt;Header&lt;/header&gt;\r\n      &lt;main className={style.FeedMain}&gt;\r\n        {\r\n          &lt;div className={style.ItemList}&gt;\r\n            {itemData.map((item, idx) =&gt; (\r\n              &lt;div key={idx} className={style.Item}&gt;\r\n                {item}\r\n              &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            ))}\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        }\r\n      &lt;/main&gt;\r\n      &lt;footer className={style.FeedFooter}&gt;Footer&lt;/footer&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst itemData = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a typical web page that has a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. If there are 30 more web pages like this, you would easily get tired of repeatedly writing HTML tags and applying the same style over and over.</p>\n<p>Instead, you can create a layout component that receives <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> as props, as in the following code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// Layout.js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport style from \"./Layout.module.css\";\r\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\";\r\n\r\nexport default function Layout({ header, main, footer }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div className={style.Container}&gt;\r\n      &lt;header className={style.Header}&gt;{header}&lt;/header&gt;\r\n      &lt;main className={style.Main}&gt;{main}&lt;/main&gt;\r\n      &lt;footer className={style.Footer}&gt;{footer}&lt;/footer&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nLayout.propTypes = {\r\n  main: PropTypes.element.isRequired,\r\n  header: PropTypes.element,\r\n  footer: PropTypes.element\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This component doesn&#8217;t require <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. So, you can use this same layout for pages regardless of whether they contain a header or a footer.</p>\n<p>Using this layout component, you can turn your feed page into a much more sophisticated block of code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// Feed.js\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport Layout from \"./Layout\";\r\nimport style from \"./Feed.module.css\";\r\n\r\nexport default function Feed() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Layout\r\n      header={&lt;div className={style.FeedHeader}&gt;Header&lt;/div&gt;}\r\n      main={\r\n        &lt;div className={style.ItemList}&gt;\r\n          {itemData.map((item, idx) =&gt; (\r\n            &lt;div key={idx} className={style.Item}&gt;\r\n              {item}\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          ))}\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      }\r\n      footer={&lt;div className={style.FeedFooter}&gt;Footer&lt;/div&gt;}\r\n    /&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst itemData = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/creating-reusable-react-components/?utm_source=rss\">A Practical Guide to Creating Reusable React Components</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

In this tutorial, we&#8217;re going to build a full-stack web application, using Django on the back end and Django Templates stylized with Bootstrap on the front end.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"requirements\">Requirements</h2>\n<p>To get the most out of this tutorial, you&#8217;d ideally have a grasp of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the basics of Python</li>\n<li>object-oriented programming in Python</li>\n<li>the basics of the Django web framework</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have previous experience with Django, don&#8217;t be afraid of continuing with this tutorial.

If you don&#8217;t have the right version of Python, you might get a message like one of these:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">Command 'python' not found\r\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">Python 2.7.18\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Python command you need to run to follow along with this tutorial will be <code>python3</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">python3 --version\r\n\r\nPython 3.9.5\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"virtualenvironments\">Virtual environments</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\">virtual environment</a> is an isolated Python environment, which includes all the files you need to run a Python program.</p>\n<p>Virtual environments are a crucial part of any Python (and Django) project, because they let us manage and share dependencies (external packages the project depends on) with other people.</p>\n<p>To create a virtual environment natively, we&#8217;ll use the built-in module <code>venv</code>, available from Python 3.6 or greater.</p>\n<p>The following command will create a virtual environment with the name <code>.venv</code> (you can choose another name if you prefer):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">python -m venv .venv\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using Ubuntu Linux, or any other Debian-based distribution, it&#8217;s possible you&#8217;ll get the following message:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"text language-text\">The virtual environment was not created successfully because pip is not available ... \r\n</code></pre>\n<p>To solve this, you can run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">sudo apt-get install python3-venv\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the command above doesn&#8217;t work, you can use <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/\">virtualenv</a>, which is another library to work with virtual environments:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">virtualenv .venv\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>After running this command, a folder named <code>.venv</code> (or the name you&#8217;ve chosen) will appear.</p>\n<p>All of the packages we install will be placed inside that directory.</p>\n<p>To activate a virtual environment, you&#8217;ll need to run a specific command depending on your OS. You can refer to the table below (extracted from the Python docs).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Platform</th>\n<th>Shell</th>\n<th>Command to activate virtual environment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>POSIX</td>\n<td>bash/zsh</td>\n<td>$ source .venv/bin/activate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>fish</td>\n<td>$ source .venv/bin/activate.fish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>csh/tcsh</td>\n<td>$ source .venv/bin/activate.csh</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>PowerShell Core</td>\n<td>$ .venv/bin/Activate.ps1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Windows</td>\n<td>cmd.exe</td>\n<td>C:> .venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>PowerShell</td>\n<td>PS C:> .venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Since I&#8217;m using a bash shell on a POSIX operative system, I&#8217;ll use this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">source .venv/bin/activate\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note how a <code>.venv</code> caption is added to my shell once I&#8217;ve activated the <code>virtualenv</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1622669492venv.png\" alt=\"Virtual environment activated\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"installingdjango\">Installing Django</h3>\n<p>Django is an external package, so we&#8217;ll need to install it with pip:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">pip install django\r\n\r\n# Use pip3 if the command above doesn't work\r\n\r\npip3 install django\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: we can always take a look at the packages installed in our <code>venv</code> with <code>pip freeze</code>.</em></p>\n<p>Next, let&#8217;s start a Django project with the name <code>config</code> with the command-line utility <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/\">django-admin</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">django-admin startproject config\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, <code>config</code> is the name of the project, and it&#8217;s used as a naming convention to keep all your projects with the same structure. For instance, <a href=\"https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django\">Django cookiecutter</a> uses this convention name to start a project.</p>\n<p>That being said, you can create the project with any other name.</p>\n<p>After running these commands, you should have the regular file structure of a Django project. You can check it with the command-line utility <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree\">tree</a>, or with any file manager.</p>\n<p><em>Note: if you can&#8217;t run <code>tree</code> you&#8217;ll need to install it.</em></p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ tree config/\r\n└── config\r\n    ├── config\r\n    │   ├── asgi.py\r\n    │   ├── __init__.py\r\n    │   ├── settings.py\r\n    │   ├── urls.py\r\n    │   └── wsgi.py\r\n    └── manage.py\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s enter the project folder with <code>cd</code>, and run the server to check everything is correctly set up:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd config/\r\n\r\npython manage.py runserver\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see a warning message pointing out that there are unapplied migrations. This is a totally normal message, and we&#8217;ll learn how to run migrations in the “<a href=\"#creatingthephotomodel\">Creating the Photo Model</a>” section.</p>\n<p>Now, visit <a href=\"http://localhost:8000/\">localhost:8000</a> in your browser. You should see the iconic Django congratulations page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1622118721django-screen.png\" alt=\"Django congrats page\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"startingthephotosharingapp\">Starting the Photo-sharing App</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/\">manage.py</a> file has the exact same capabilities as <code>django-admin</code>, so we&#8217;ll use it many times during this tutorial.</p>\n<p>Its location is in the root folder of the project, and each time we want to run a command with it, we need to enter the project directory.</p>\n<p>Remember to always list the files of the directory you&#8217;re in with <code>ls</code>, to check if we&#8217;re in the correct spot:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ ls\r\nAnother-files.. manage.py\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>With these tips in mind, it&#8217;s time to start the main app of the project. To do this we open a new shell (so the local server is still running), and use the <code>manage.py</code> with the command <code>startapp</code>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: each time we open a new shell session, we&#8217;ll need to activate the virtual environment again.</em></p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">source .venv/bin/activate\r\ncd config\r\npython manage.py startapp photoapp\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, the name of the app is <strong>photoapp</strong>. Once again, you can create it with whatever name you want.</p>\n<p>Every time we create an app we must install it. We can do this in the <code>config/settings.py</code> file by adding <code>photoapp</code> to the <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> variable:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\"># config/settings.py\r\n\r\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\r\n    'django.contrib.admin',\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    # Custom apps\r\n    'photoapp',\r\n]\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we&#8217;ll enter the app directory and create an empty <code>urls.py</code> file. We can do this by running <code>touch</code>, or by creating it with a graphical file manager:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd photoapp/\r\n\r\ntouch urls.py\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lastly, let&#8217;s include all the URL patterns of the photo-sharing app in the overall project. To accomplish this, we&#8217;ll use the <code>django.urls.include</code> function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\"># config/urls.py\r\n\r\nfrom django.urls import path, include # Import this function\r\n\r\nurlpatterns = [\r\n    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\r\n    # Main app\r\n    path('', include('photoapp.urls')),\r\n]\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code above will include all the URL patterns of the <code>photoapp/urls.py</code> to the project.</p>\n<p>If you take a look at the shell in which the server is running, you&#8217;ll see an error:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">raise ImproperlyConfigured(msg.format(name=self.urlconf_name)) ....\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s because we haven&#8217;t created the <code>urlpatterns</code> list inside the <code>photopp/urls.py</code> file.</p>\n<p>To solve this, create an empty list named <code>urlpatterns</code>. We&#8217;re going to populate that variable later with Django paths:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\"># photoapp/urls.py\r\n\r\n# Empty patterns\r\nurlpatterns = [\r\n\r\n]\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: the advantage of using this approach is that we can make the photoapp reusable, by including all the code needed inside of it.</em></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/django-photo-sharing-app/?utm_source=rss\">Build a Photo-sharing App with Django</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

We&#8217;ll also look at how these can be enhanced through the use of CSS and JavaScript.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisconstraintvalidation\">What is Constraint Validation?</h2>\n<p>Every form field has a purpose. And this purpose is often governed by <strong>contraints</strong> — or the rules governing what should and shouldn&#8217;t be entered into each form field. For example, an <code>email</code> field will require a valid email address; a <code>password</code> field might require certain types of characters and have a minimum number of required characters; and a text field might have a limit on how many characters can be entered.</p>\n<p>Modern browsers have the ability to check that these constraints are being observed by users, and can warn them when those rules have been breached. This is known as <strong>contstraint validation</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"clientsidevsserversidevalidation\">Client-side vs Server-side Validation</h2>\n<p>The majority of JavaScript code written in the early years of the language handled client-side form validation. Even today, developers spend significant time writing functions to check field values. <em>Is this still necessary in modern browsers? Probably not</em>. In most cases, it really depends on what you&#8217;re trying to do.</p>\n<p>But first, here&#8217;s a big warning message:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Client-side validation is a nicety which can prevent common data-entry errors before an app wastes time and bandwidth sending data to a server. <strong>It&#8217;s not a substitute for server-side validation!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 1em;\">Always sanitize data server-side. Not every request will come from a browser. Even when it does, there&#8217;s no guarantee the browser validated the data. Anyone who knows how to open a browser&#8217;s developer tools can also bypass your lovingly crafted HTML and JavaScript.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"html5inputfields\">HTML5 Input Fields</h2>\n<p>HTML offers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea\"><code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code></a> for multiline text boxes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select\"><code>&lt;select&gt;</code></a> for a drop-down list of options</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button\"><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></a> for &hellip; buttons</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But you&#8217;ll use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input\"><code>&lt;input&gt;</code></a> most often:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" /&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>type</code> attribute sets the control type, and there&#8217;s a large choice of options:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><code>type</code></th>\n<th>description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>button</code></td>\n<td>a button with no default behavior</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>checkbox</code></td>\n<td>a check/tick box</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>color</code></td>\n<td>a color picker</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>date</code></td>\n<td>a date picker for the year, month, and day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>datetime-local</code></td>\n<td>a date and time picker</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>email</code></td>\n<td>an email entry field</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>file</code></td>\n<td>a file picker</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>hidden</code></td>\n<td>a hidden field</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>image</code></td>\n<td>a button which displays the image defined by the <code>src</code> attribute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>month</code></td>\n<td>a month and year picker</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>number</code></td>\n<td>a number entry field</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>password</code></td>\n<td>a password entry field with obscured text</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>radio</code></td>\n<td>a radio button</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>range</code></td>\n<td>a slider control</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>reset</code></td>\n<td>a button that resets all form inputs to their default values (but avoid using this, as it&#8217;s rarely useful)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>search</code></td>\n<td>a search entry field</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>submit</code></td>\n<td>a form submission button</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>tel</code></td>\n<td>a telephone number entry field</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>text</code></td>\n<td>a text entry field</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>time</code></td>\n<td>a time picker with no time zone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>url</code></td>\n<td>a URL entry field</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>week</code></td>\n<td>a week number and year picker</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The browser falls back to <code>text</code> if you omit the <code>type</code> attribute or it doesn&#8217;t support an option. Modern browsers have good support for all types, but old browsers will still show a text entry field.</p>\n<p>Other useful <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> attributes include:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>attribute</th>\n<th>description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>accept</code></td>\n<td>file upload type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>alt</code></td>\n<td>alternative text for the image types</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>autocomplete</code></td>\n<td>hint for field auto-completion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>autofocus</code></td>\n<td>focus field on page load</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>capture</code></td>\n<td>media capture input method</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>checked</code></td>\n<td>checkbox/radio is checked</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>disabled</code></td>\n<td>disable the control (it won&#8217;t be validated or have its value submitted)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>form</code></td>\n<td>associate with a form using this ID</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>formaction</code></td>\n<td>URL for submission on submit and image buttons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>inputmode</code></td>\n<td>data type hint</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>list</code></td>\n<td>ID of <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-datalist-autocomplete/\"><code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> autocomplete options</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>max</code></td>\n<td>maximum value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>maxlength</code></td>\n<td>maximum string length</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>min</code></td>\n<td>minimum value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>minlength</code></td>\n<td>minimum string length</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>name</code></td>\n<td>name of control, as submitted to server</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>pattern</code></td>\n<td>a regular expression pattern, such as <code>[A-Z]+</code> for one or more uppercase characters</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>placeholder</code></td>\n<td>placeholder text when the field value is empty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>readonly</code></td>\n<td>the field is not editable, but it will still be validated and submitted</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>required</code></td>\n<td>the field is required</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>size</code></td>\n<td>the size of the control (often overridden in CSS)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>spellcheck</code></td>\n<td>set <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> spell-checking</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>src</code></td>\n<td>image URL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>step</code></td>\n<td>incremental values in numbers and ranges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>type</code></td>\n<td>field type (see above)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>value</code></td>\n<td>the initial value</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"htmloutputfields\">HTML Output Fields</h3>\n<p>As well as input types, HTML5 provides read-only outputs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/output\"><code>output</code></a>: a text result of a calculation or user action</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress\"><code>progress</code></a>: a progress bar with <code>value</code> and <code>max</code> attributes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter\"><code>meter</code></a>: a scale which can change between green, amber, and red depending on the values set for the <code>value</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>low</code>, <code>high</code>, and <code>optimum</code> attributes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"inputlabels\">Input Labels</h2>\n<p>Fields should have an associated <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, which you can wrap around the element:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;label&gt;your name &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" /&gt;&lt;label&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or link the field&#8217;s <code>id</code> to the label using a <code>for</code> attribute:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;label for=\"nameid\"&gt;your name&lt;/label&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"nameid\" name=\"name\" /&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Labels are important for accessibility. You may have encountered forms which use a <code>placeholder</code> to save screen space:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"your name\" /&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The placeholder text disappears once the user types something &mdash; even a single space. It&#8217;s better to show a label than force the user remember what the field wanted!</p>\n<h2 id=\"inputbehaviors\">Input Behaviors</h2>\n<p>Field types and constraint attributes change the browser&#8217;s input behavior. For example, a <code>number</code> input shows a numeric keyboard on mobile devices. The field may show a spinner and keyboard up/down cursor presses will increment and decrement values.</p>\n<p>Most field types are obvious, but there are exceptions. For example, credit cards are numeric, but the increment/decrement spinner is useless and it&#8217;s too easy to press up or down when entering a 16-digit number. It&#8217;s better to use a standard <code>text</code> type, but set the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode\"><code>inputmode</code> attribute</a> to <code>numeric</code>, which shows an appropriate keyboard. Setting <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete\"><code>autocomplete=\"cc-number\"</code></a> also suggests any pre-configured or previously entered card numbers.</p>\n<p>Using the correct field <code>type</code> and <code>autocorrect</code> offers benefits which would be difficult to achieve in JavaScript. For example, some mobile browsers can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>import credit card details by scanning a card using the camera</li>\n<li>import <a href=\"https://web.dev/sms-otp-form/#autocomplete%22one-time-code%22\">one-time-codes sent by SMS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"automaticvalidation\">Automatic Validation</h2>\n<p>The browser ensures an input value adheres with the constraints defined by the <code>type</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>step</code>, <code>minlength</code>, <code>maxlength</code>, <code>pattern</code>, and <code>required</code> attributes. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;input type=\"number\" min=\"1\" max=\"100\" required /&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Attempting to submit an empty value prevents form submission and shows the following message in Chrome:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1625835070input-number.png\" alt=\"input required validation message\" /></p>\n<p>The spinners will not permit values outside the 1 to 100 range. Similar validation messages appear if you type a string which is not a number. <em>All without a single line of JavaScript.</em></p>\n<p>You can stop browser validation by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adding a <code>novalidate</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element</li>\n<li>adding a <code>formnovalidate</code> attribute to the submission button or image</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"creatingcustomjavascriptinputs\">Creating Custom JavaScript Inputs</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re writing a new JavaScript-based date entry component, please stop and step away from your keyboard!</p>\n<p>Writing custom input controls is difficult. You have to consider the mouse, keyboard, touch, speech, accessibility, screen dimensions, and what happens when JavaScript fails. You&#8217;re also creating a different user experience. Perhaps your control is superior to the standard date picker on desktop, iOS, and Android, but the unfamiliar UI will confuse some users.</p>\n<p>There are three primary reasons developers choose to create JavaScript-based inputs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1standardcontrolsaredifficulttostyle\">1. Standard controls are difficult to style</h3>\n<p>CSS styling is limited and often requires hacks, such as overlaying an input with its label&#8217;s <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements. The situation is improving, but question any design which prioritizes form over function.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2moderninputtypesarenotsupportedinoldbrowsers\">2. Modern <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> types are not supported in old browsers</h3>\n<p>In essence, you&#8217;re coding for Internet Explorer. IE users won&#8217;t get a date picker but can still enter dates in <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format. If your client insists, then load a polyfill in IE only. There&#8217;s no need to burden modern browsers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3yourequireanewinputtypewhichhasneverbeenimplementedbefore\">3. You require a new input type which has never been implemented before</h3>\n<p>These situations are rare, but always start with appropriate HTML5 fields. They&#8217;re fast, and they work even before the script has loaded. You can progressively enhance fields as necessary. For example, a sprinkling of JavaScript can ensure a calendar event&#8217;s end date occurs after a starting date.</p>\n<p>In summary: <em>avoid re-inventing HTML controls!</em></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/html-forms-constraint-validation-complete-guide/?utm_source=rss\">The Complete Guide to HTML Forms and Constraint Validation</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

In our last article, “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/notion-api-javascript-sdk/\">Getting Started with the Notion API and Its JavaScript SDK</a>”, we delved into how to use Notion’s API and created a small interface to interact with it. This article now will explore another use case for the Notion API: creating a JavaScript quiz.</strong></p>\n<p><em>While no previous knowledge is needed to follow along with this article (I&#8217;ll provide all the required steps), we&#8217;ll be dealing with front-end and back-end code, as there&#8217;s a bit of Node.js and Express setup involved, so some JavaScript skills are assumed.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"javascriptquizprojectsetup\">JavaScript Quiz Project Setup</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to split our setup into two sections. In the first one, we&#8217;ll walk through the required setup on the Notion side, and one the second part we&#8217;ll work with our code.</p>\n<p>To follow along, you&#8217;ll need a Notion account (more on that below), as well as a recent copy of <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Node installed on your machine</a>. As ever, the <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/notion-api-javascript-quiz\">final code for the tutorial can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thenotionsetup\">The Notion Setup</h2>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t already have a Notion account, please create one by following <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/login\">this link</a>. After creating your account and logging in, create a new page by choosing <strong>Add a page</strong> and give it a name. For this tutorial, we&#8217;ll use a <code>Table</code> database. Although it&#8217;s not the ideal database to build a quiz, it&#8217;s the closest we can achieve with Notion!</p>\n<h3 id=\"insertinginformationintothetable\">Inserting information into the table</h3>\n<p>Now that we have our empty <code>Table</code>, we need to figure out how to properly insert our information into it.<br />\nOur intended schema for our quiz is the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\r\n  \"1\": {\r\n    \"Question\": \"Which is the purpose of JavaScript?\",\r\n    \"Answers\": {\r\n      \"1\": \"To style HTML Pages\",\r\n      \"2\": \"To add interactivity to HTML pages\",\r\n      \"3\": \"To perform server side scripting operations\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Correct\": \"To add interactivy to HTML pages\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"2\": {\r\n    \"Question\": \"To insert a JavaScript into an HTML page, which tag is used?\",\r\n    \"Answers\": {\r\n      \"1\": \"&lt;script='java'&gt;\",\r\n      \"2\": \"&lt;javascript&gt;\",\r\n      \"3\": \"&lt;script&gt;\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Correct\": \"&lt;script&gt;\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"3\": {\r\n    \"Question\": \"Which of the following is correct to write “Hello World” on the web page?\",\r\n    \"Answers\": {\r\n      \"1\": \"print('Hello World')\",\r\n      \"2\": \"document.write('Hello World')\",\r\n      \"3\": \"response.write('Hello World')\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"Correct\": \"document.write('Hello World')\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notion isn&#8217;t really built for this type of database, so we need to get creative with it! 💡 So our <code>Question</code> column will be just a <code>Title</code> (which works great) and our <code>Correct</code> column will be of type <code>Text</code> (which also works as intended). For our multiple options, though, we need to do something different! My approach to it is to use the <code>Multi-select</code> field type so I can write multiple results into the same cell (we&#8217;ll see down the path what the data retrieved from this looks like). So our <code>Table</code> should look like the following image as the end result.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633429075RuiSousaNotionDatabaseJavaScriptQuiz.jpeg\" alt=\"Our Notion Table filled in with our questions, answers and correct choice\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"creatingournotionapiintegration\">Creating our Notion API integration</h3>\n<p>Now we need to go to the Notion API <a href=\"https://developers.notion.com/\">website</a> to create our integration. Press the <strong>My Integrations</strong> button on the top right corner and then click on <strong>Create new integration</strong>. We need to fill in our title and be sure to choose our Associated workspace (it will be chosen by default but make sure of this). If we press <strong>Submit</strong>, we&#8217;ll be directed to a new page with an Internal Integration Token (we&#8217;ll use this in our code) and with two option boxes for where we want to use our integration. We don&#8217;t need to do anything on this page other than copy our token and press <strong>Save changes</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now we go back to our Notion workspace. In our newly created Notion database, we want to press <strong>Share</strong>, then <strong>Invite</strong>. We&#8217;ll then be able to choose our newly created integration. If we choose it and press <strong>Invite</strong>, our Notion setup is done. Well done! 🙌</p>\n<h2 id=\"thecodesetup\">The Code Setup</h2>\n<p>For our code setup, we&#8217;ll use a Notion template repository (which we can then use on any of our Notion API projects!) that already has the initial code required to work with Notion&#8217;s API. This repo can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/notion-api-javascript-starter\">here</a>, so be sure to fork it and clone it to accompany our project! If you&#8217;re interested in what all the bits of code do, please refer to “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/notion-api-javascript-sdk/\">Getting Started with the Notion API and Its JavaScript SDK</a>”, since we go into a lot of detail for every bit of code (the repo also has a <code>README</code> that should explain what it does!).</p>\n<h3 id=\"installingdependencies\">Installing dependencies</h3>\n<p>After forking and cloning our Notion template repo, our first step is to install our dependencies, so make sure to run <code>yarn</code> or <code>npm install</code> on our terminal inside the folder. In this project we have three dependencies: the <a href=\"https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js\">@notionhq/client</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv\">dotenv</a> and <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express</a>. We&#8217;ll use dotenv to manage our variables and keep them safe (such as the one we saw on our integration) and Express to create our back end and server for our application.</p>\n<p>To manage our variables with dotenv, create a <code>.env</code> file at the root of our project and paste the following there:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">NOTION_API_KEY = YOUR_TOKEN_HERE\r\nNOTION_API_DATABASE = YOUR_DATABASE_ID_HERE\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Our <code>NOTION_API_KEY</code> is the key that we can find in our <strong>Integrations</strong>, and our <code>NOTION_API_DATABASE</code> can be found by going to the created Notion page and looking at the browser&#8217;s URL bar. It comes after your workspace name (if we have one) and the slash (<code>myworkspace/</code>) and before the question mark (<code>?</code>). The ID is 32 characters long, containing numbers and letters:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">https://www.notion.so/myworkspace/a8aec43384f447ed84390e8e42c2e089?v=...\r\n                                  |--------- Database ID --------|\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we&#8217;re worried about having Notion&#8217;s API keys on a file inside our repo, notice that on our <code>.gitignore</code> we have the <code>.env</code> file there; the <code>.gitignore</code> allows us to put different file/folder names inside, and that means that these files/folders won’t be added to our repo when we push our code.</p>\n<p>Now that we have our initial repository and we have the required credentials from Notion, we can start working on our quiz!</p>\n<h2 id=\"grabbingthejavascriptquizdata\">Grabbing the JavaScript Quiz Data</h2>\n<p>We should first check if we&#8217;re successfully connected to our Notion database, so we&#8217;ll navigate to our <code>.index.js</code> file and log our <code>reponse</code> variable (see how we&#8217;re grabbing our <code>databaseId</code> from our <code>.env</code> file and using it on our <em>database query</em>?).</p>\n<p>If we then run <code>yarn start</code>, we should see something like the following screenshot on our terminal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633429265RuiSousaWhatResponseQueryRetrieves.jpeg\" alt=\"What logging the response query retrieves\" /></p>\n<p>Seeing this on our terminal means that we&#8217;re properly connected to our Notion database and that we can now get our required data. Our <code>getDatabase</code> function will look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">exports.getDatabase = async function () {\r\n  const response = await notion.databases.query({ database_id: databaseId });\r\n\r\n  const responseResults = response.results.map((page) =&gt; {\r\n    return {\r\n      id: page.id,\r\n      question: page.properties.Question.title[0].plain_text,\r\n      answers: page.properties.Answers.multi_select,\r\n      correct: page.properties.Correct.rich_text[0].plain_text,\r\n    };\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return responseResults;\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>With <code>responseResults</code>, we&#8217;re mapping over our <code>results</code> (matching the entries in our database) and we&#8217;re mapping the paths for different properties to names that we&#8217;re choosing (in this case, <code>id</code>, <code>question</code>, <code>answers</code> and <code>correct</code>). Notice how specific the object path is. This is by design, which means that, when developing and working with your own database, you should continuously investigate the returned properties until you find the information you&#8217;re looking for (it&#8217;s really a matter of trial and error).</p>\n<p>With this new code, we&#8217;re pretty much making a call to our API and picking the properties that we want to use in our code, which means that we&#8217;re ready to work with them on our interface!</p>\n<h2 id=\"showingourdatainthebrowser\">Showing Our Data in the Browser</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start by dealing with our HTML and CSS, since they&#8217;re pretty direct! We won&#8217;t do any changes on our HTML from the template, and on our <code>style.css</code> we can paste the following code beneath the existing one:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.questionContainer {\r\n  padding: 30px;\r\n\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n  justify-content: center;\r\n  align-items: center;\r\n\r\n  box-shadow: rgba(149, 157, 165, 0.2) 0px 8px 24px;\r\n  border-radius: 10px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.numberElement {\r\n  margin: 0px auto 10px;\r\n\r\n  font-size: 12px;\r\n  font-weight: 700;\r\n  text-transform: uppercase;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.question {\r\n  margin: 0px auto 40px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.answersDiv {\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n  gap: 20px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.answerOption {\r\n  padding: 20px;\r\n  margin: 0px;\r\n\r\n  font-size: 18px;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n\r\n  border: 1px solid rgb(42, 43, 44);\r\n  border-radius: 40px;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We won&#8217;t see these styling changes yet, but we can now focus on the functionality, which is the more important part of this tutorial.</p>\n<p>If we now go to the <code>main.js</code> file inside the <code>public</code> folder, we&#8217;ll see that we&#8217;re already grabbing our data from our back end with the <code>getDataFromBackend</code> function. If you&#8217;re confused by this, “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/notion-api-javascript-sdk/\">Getting Started with the Notion API and Its JavaScript SDK</a>” has a lengthier explanation for it, but basically on our <code>server.js</code> we created a route that gets our database, and here on <code>getDataFromBackend</code> we&#8217;re making a <code>fetch</code> to that same route, which will grab our data for us.</p>\n<p>Notice how inside <code>addData</code> we already have <code>const data = await getDataFromBackend();</code>. This means that we&#8217;re ready to start working with our data, and we can actually check this! <code>log</code> this <code>data</code> variable and we should see, on our console, an array of our database entries.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633429330RuiSousaLoggingOurData.jpeg\" alt=\"Logging our data\" /></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/notion-api-javascript-quiz/?utm_source=rss\">Use the Notion API to Create a Quiz with JavaScript</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

In this article, we&#8217;ll look at the <code>react-textfit</code> library, which makes it easy to create responsive React components that display predictably wherever they appear in a layout.</strong> </p>\n<h2 id=\"thetextfittingissue\">The Text-fitting Issue</h2>\n<p>Since React components are pieces of JavaScript code describing a particular section of your UI, they&#8217;re virtually independent of each other. And their visual styles are often embedded within them, as part of their definition. This can be quite helpful, given that they&#8217;re likely to be used in different locations and layouts. </p>\n<p>But there are also some downsides to embedding styles within a reusable component. One example is seen in the case of responsiveness. Say you want a line of text — such as a heading — to completely fill the space reserved for it in terms of height and width, but not to wrap — all without having to write custom CSS rules for every possible situation. (Examples of where you might want this include business slogans, advertisement messages, or text embedded in navbar components.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633581044lines1.jpg\" alt=\"Each component you create may have more than one function\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"cssandportability\">CSS and portability</h3>\n<p>While defining the style of your responsive React component, you&#8217;d want to take into account the size, layout, or style of each possible parent component that might wrap it to adapt the font size accordingly. As you can imagine, taking every possible container size into account isn&#8217;t really viable — even if you could do it with CSS. You&#8217;d be chasing far too many viewport scenarios for it to be practical to write media queries. But other than media queries, there isn&#8217;t really a way in CSS to ensure that a block of text will always fit within a single line.</p>\n<h3 id=\"createreusablereactcomponents\">Create reusable React components</h3>\n<p>Thankfully, some React libraries can be used to address this issue effortlessly. They allow you to define reusable React components where text behaves as expected regardless of the container the reusable component is placed in. By the end of this article, you&#8217;ll be able to use of these libraries to tackle the aforementioned text fitting problem and make a component reusable. So, let&#8217;s take a look at everything you should know to make your text automatically fit the available space in React.</p>\n<p>First, we&#8217;ll look at why facing such a problem is so important and why common solutions may not be enough, especially when using React. Then, the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-textfit\"><code>react-textfit</code></a> React library will be presented and used to implement a solution for both single and multi-line text.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633581320lines2.jpg\" alt=\"Each component you create will properties for different environments\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"textfittingprobleminreusablecomponents\">Text Fitting Problem in Reusable Components</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the following demo explaining the text fitting problem with an example.</p>\n<p><!-- https://codepen.io/antozanini95/pen/ExXXmaO --></p>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"500\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-slug-hash=\"KKqOxQV\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n<span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/KKqOxQV\"><br />\nText fitting problem</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br />\non <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p><script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script></p>\n<p>The goal is to make a headline fit the space reserved for it, regardless of the size of the user&#8217;s screen. In this example, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Viewport_concepts\">viewport units</a> are used to define the <code>font-size</code> for the headline. Consequently, while resizing the red-bordered <code>iframe</code> representing the user&#8217;s screen, the headline will always fit its parent <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. So this method certainly allows the headline text to adapt to any screen width. However, the <code>Headline</code> styled component is not reusable. This is because it&#8217;s designed with only this particular text in mind. By adding to the headline text, or resizing the parent <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, the text will no longer fit on one line. (You can experiment with changing the text in the demo.) We really want a reusable component to be more adaptable than this.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, another solution is offered by <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries\">CSS media queries</a>, which allow you to adapt your text font size according to the screen size.

It was at this point that we realized we needed to make a significant change in our approach towards performance, and that we must embrace performance as part of our culture.</p>\n\n<p>Implementing this change <strong>enabled us to take major steps</strong> such as updating our infrastructure along with completely rewriting our core functionality from the ground up. We deployed these enhancements gradually over time to ensure that our users didn’t experience any disruptions, but instead only a consistent improvement of their site speed.</p>\n\n<p>Since implementing these changes, we have seen a dramatic improvement in the performance of websites built and hosted on our platform. In particular, the worldwide ratio of Wix websites that receive a good (green) CWV score has increased from 4% to over 33%, which means <strong>an increase of 737%</strong>. We also expect this upwards trend to continue as we roll out additional improvements to our platform.</p>\n\n<p>You can see the impact of these efforts in the <a href=\"https://datastudio.google.com/s/lIkQgAX3SIs\">Core Web Vitals Technology Report</a> from <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report\">Google Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)</a> / <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/\">HTTP Archive</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"\n  \n    break-out article__image\n  \n  \n  \">\n  \n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8f53e04f-3b31-4900-b385-83b426169171/8-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png\">\n    \n    <img\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      decoding=\"async\"\n      importance=\"low\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"800\"\n\t\t\theight=\"529\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsrcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8f53e04f-3b31-4900-b385-83b426169171/8-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 400w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8f53e04f-3b31-4900-b385-83b426169171/8-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 800w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8f53e04f-3b31-4900-b385-83b426169171/8-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 1200w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8f53e04f-3b31-4900-b385-83b426169171/8-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 1600w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8f53e04f-3b31-4900-b385-83b426169171/8-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 2000w\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8f53e04f-3b31-4900-b385-83b426169171/8-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsizes=\"100vw\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Ratio of sessions with good CWV per platform.\"\n\t\t/>\n    \n    </a>\n  \n\n  \n    <figcaption class=\"op-vertical-bottom\">\n      Ratio of sessions with good CWV per platform.

They also likely have <strong>increased conversion rates and lower bounce rates</strong> due to the improved visitor experience.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s take a deeper look into the actions and processes we put in place in order to achieve these significant results.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-wix-challenge\">The Wix Challenge</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s begin by describing who we are, what are our use-cases, and our challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Wix is a SaaS platform providing products and services for any type of user to create an online presence. This includes building websites, hosting websites, managing campaigns, SEO, analytics, CRM, and much more. It was founded in 2006 and has since grown to have over 210 million users in 190 countries, and hosts over five million domains. In addition to content websites, Wix also supports e-commerce, blogs, forums, bookings and events, and membership and authentication. And Wix has its own app store with apps and themes for restaurants, fitness, hotels, and much more. To support all this, we have over 5,000 employees spread around the globe.</p>\n\n<p>This high rate of growth, coupled with the current scale and diversity of offerings presents a huge challenge when setting out to <strong>improve performance</strong>. It’s one thing to identify bottlenecks and implement optimizations for a specific website or a few similar websites, and quite another when dealing with many millions of websites, having such a wide variety of functionality, and an almost total freedom of design.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, we cannot optimize for a specific layout or set of features that are known in advance. Instead, we have to accommodate all of this variability, mostly on-demand. On the positive side, since there are so many users and websites on Wix, improvements that we make benefit millions of websites, and can have a positive impact on the Web as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>There are more challenges for us in addition to scale and diversity:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Retaining existing design and behavior</strong><br />\nA key requirement we set for ourselves was to improve the performance of all existing websites built on Wix without altering any aspect of their look and feel. So essentially, they need to continue to look and work exactly the same, only operate faster.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintaining development velocity</strong><br />\nImproving performance requires a significant amount of resources and effort. And the last thing we want is to negatively impact our developers&rsquo; momentum, or our ability to release new features at a high rate. So once a certain level of performance is achieved, we want to be able to preserve it without being constantly required to invest additional effort, or slow down the development process. In other words, we needed to find a way to automate the process of preventing performance degradations.</li>\n<li><strong>Education</strong><br />\nIn order to create change across our entire organization, we needed to get all the relevant employees, partners, and even customers up to speed about performance quickly and efficiently. This required a lot of planning and forethought, and quite a bit of trial and error.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"creating-a-performance-culture\">Creating A Performance Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Initially, at Wix, performance was a task assigned to a relatively small dedicated group within the company. This team was tasked with identifying and addressing specific performance bottlenecks, while others throughout the organization were only brought in on a case-by-case basis. While some noticeable progress was made, it was <strong>challenging to implement significant changes</strong> just for the sake of speed.</p>\n\n<p>This was because the amount of effort required often exceeded the capacity of the performance team, and also because ongoing work on various features and capabilities often got in the way. Another limiting factor was the lack of data and insight into exactly what the bottlenecks were so that we could know exactly where to focus our efforts for maximum effect.</p>\n\n<div data-audience=\"non-subscriber\" data-remove=\"true\" class=\"feature-panel-container\"><span class=\"feature-panel__desc\">More after jump!

That in order to provide the level of performance that our users require and expect we need to operate at the organizational level. And that if we do not provide this level of performance it will be detrimental to our business and future success. There were several catalysts for this understanding, some due to changes in the Web ecosystem in general, and others to our own market segment in particular:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Changes in device landscape</strong><br />\nSix years ago, over 70% of sessions for Wix websites originated from desktops, with under 30% coming from mobile devices. Since then the situation has flipped, and now over 70% of sessions originate on mobile. While mobile devices have come a long way in terms of network and CPU speed, many of them are still significantly underpowered when compared to desktops, especially in countries where mobile connectivity is still poor. As a result, unless performance improves, many visitors experience a decline in the quality of experience they receive over time.</li>\n<li><strong>Customer expectations</strong><br />\nOver the past few years, we’ve seen a significant shift in customer expectations regarding performance. Thanks to activities by Google and others, website owners now understand that having good loading speed is a major factor in the success of their sites. As a result, customers prefer platforms that provide good performance &mdash; and avoid or leave those that don’t.</li>\n<li><strong>Google search ranking</strong><br />\nBack in 2018 Google announced that sites with especially slow pages on mobile would be penalized. But starting in 2021, Google shifted its approach to instead <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/experience/page-experience#signals\">boost the ranking of mobile sites that have good performance</a>. This has increased the motivation of site owners and SEOs to use platforms that can create fast sites.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavier websites</strong><br />\nAs the demand for faster websites increases, so does the expectation that websites provide a richer and more engaging experience. This includes features like videos and animations, sophisticated interactions, and greater customization. As <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web#bytesTotal\">websites become heavier and more complex</a>, the task of maintaining performance becomes ever more challenging.</li>\n<li><strong>Better tooling and metrics standardization</strong><br />\nMeasuring website performance used to be challenging and required specific expertise. But in recent years the ability to gauge the speed and responsiveness of websites has improved significantly and has become much simpler, thanks to tools like <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse\">Google Lighthouse</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\">PageSpeed Insights</a>. Moreover, the industry has primarily standardized on Google’s Core Web Vitals (CWV) performance metrics, and monitoring them is now integrated into services such as the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520\">Google Search Console</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These changes dramatically shifted our perception of website performance from being just a part of our offerings to become an imperative company focus and a strategic priority. And that in order to achieve this strategy implementing a culture of performance throughout the organization is a must. In order to accomplish this, we took a two-pronged approach. First, at an “all hands” company update, our CEO announced that going forward ensuring good performance for websites built on our platform will be <strong>a strategic priority for the company as a whole</strong>. And that the various units within the company will be measured on their ability to deliver on this goal.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the performance team underwent a huge transformation in order to support the company-wide prioritization of performance. It went from working on specific speed enhancements to interfacing with all levels of the organization, in order to support their performance efforts. The first task was providing education on <strong>what website performance actually means</strong>, and how it can be measured. And once the teams started working off of the knowledge, it meant organizing performance-focused design and code reviews, training and education, plus providing tools and assets to support these ongoing efforts.</p>\n\n<p>To this end, the team built on the expertise that it had already gained while working on specific performance projects. And it also engaged with the performance community as a whole, for example by attending conferences, bringing in domain experts, and studying up on modern architectures such as the Jamstack.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"measuring-and-monitoring\">Measuring And Monitoring</h2>\n\n<p>Peter Drucker, one of the best-known management consultants, famously stated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>“If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”</blockquote>\n\n<p>This statement is true for management, and it’s undoubtedly true for website performance.</p>\n\n<p>But which metrics should be measured in order to determine website performance? Over the years many metrics have been proposed and used, which made it difficult to compare results taken from different tools. In other words, <strong>the field lacked standardization</strong>. This changed approximately two years ago when Google introduced three primary metrics for measuring website performance, known collectively as Google Core Web Vitals (CWV).</p>\n\n<p>The three metrics are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>LCP</strong>: <a href=\"https://web.dev/lcp/\">Largest Contentful Paint</a> (measures visibility)</li>\n<li><strong>FID</strong>: <a href=\"https://web.dev/fid/\">First Input Delay</a> (measures response time)</li>\n<li><strong>CLS</strong>: <a href=\"https://web.dev/cls/\">Cumulative Layout Shift</a> (measures visual stability)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>CWV have enabled the industry to focus on a small number of metrics that cover the main aspects of the website loading experience. And the fact that Google is now using CWV as a search ranking signal provides additional motivation for people to improve them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong>: <em>“<a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/complete-guide-measure-core-web-vitals/\">An In-Depth Guide To Measuring Core Web Vitals</a>” by Barry Pollard</em></p>\n\n<p>At Wix, we focus on CWV when analyzing field data, but also use lab measurements during the development process. In particular, lab tests are critical for implementing <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Performance_budgets\">performance budgets</a> in order to prevent performance degradations. The best implementations of performance budgets integrate their enforcement into the CI/CD process, so they are applied automatically, and prevent deployment to production when a regression is detected. When such a regression does occur it breaks the build, forcing the team to fix it before deployment can proceed.</p>\n\n<p>There are various performance budgeting products and open-source tools available, but we decided to create our own custom budgeting service called <strong>Perfer</strong>. This is because we operate at a much larger scale than most web development operations, and at any given moment hundreds of different components are being developed at Wix and are used in thousands of different combinations in millions of different websites.</p>\n\n<p>This requires the ability to test a very large number of configurations. Moreover, in order to avoid breaking builds with random fluctuations, tests that measure performance metrics or scores are run multiple times and an aggregate of the results is used for the budget. In order to accommodate such a high number of test runs without negatively impacting build time, Perfer executes the performance measurements in parallel on a cluster of dedicated servers called <strong>WatchTower</strong>. Currently, WatchTower is able to execute up to 1,000 Lighthouse tests per minute.</p>\n\n<p>After deployment performance data is collected anonymously from all Wix sessions in the field. This is especially important in our case because the huge variety of Wix websites makes it effectively impossible to test all relevant configurations and scenarios “in the lab.” By collecting and analyzing RUM data, we ensure that we have the best possible insight into the experiences of actual visitors to the websites. If we identify that a certain deployment degrades performance and harms that experience, even though this degradation was not identified by our lab tests, we can quickly roll it back.</p>\n\n<p>Another <strong>advantage of field measurements</strong> is that they match the approach taken by Google in order to collect performance data into the CrUX database. Since it is the CrUX data that is used as an input for Google’s performance ranking signal, utilizing the same approach for performance analysis is very important.</p>\n\n<p>All Wix sessions contain custom instrumentation code that gathers performance metrics and transmits this information anonymously back to our telemetry servers. In addition to the three CWV, this code also reports Time To First Byte (<strong>TTFB</strong>), First Contentful Paint (<strong>FCP</strong>), Total Blocking Time (<strong>TBT</strong>), and Time To Interactive (<strong>TTI</strong>), and also low-level metrics such as DNS lookup time and SSL handshake time. Collecting all this information makes it possible for us to not only quickly identify performance issues in production, but also to analyze the root causes of such issues. For example, we can determine if an issue was caused by changes in our own software by the changes in our infrastructure configuration, or even by issues affecting third-party services that we utilize (such as CDNs).</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-our-services-and-infrastructure\">Upgrading Our Services And Infrastructure</h2>\n\n<p>Back when I joined Wix seven years ago, we only had a single data center (along with a fallback data center) in the USA which was used to serve users from all around the world. Since then we’ve expanded the number of data centers significantly, and have multiple such centers spread around the globe. This ensures that wherever our users connect from, they’ll be serviced both quickly and reliably. In addition, we use CDNs from multiple providers to <strong>ensure rapid content delivery regardless of location</strong>. This is especially important given that we now have users in 190 countries.</p>\n\n<p>In order to make the best possible use of this enhanced infrastructure, we completely redesigned and rewrote significant portions of our front-end code. The goal was to shift as much of the computation as possible off of the browsers and onto fast servers. This is especially beneficial in the case of mobile devices, which are often less powerful and slower. In addition, this significantly reduced the amount of JavaScript code that needs to be downloaded by the browser.</p>\n\n<p>Reducing JavaScript size almost always benefits performance because it decreases the overhead of the actual download as well as parsing and execution.

The results of some of these APIs are also cached in a CDN as appropriate. For example, in the case of a shopping cart checkout icon, the HTML for the button is generated on the server, but the actual number of items in the cart is determined on the client-side and then rendered into that icon. This way, the page HTML can be cached even though each visitor is able to see a different item count value. If the HTML of the page does need to change, for example, if the site owner publishes a new version, then the copy in the CDN is immediately purged.</p>\n\n<p>In order to reduce the impact of computations on end-point devices, we moved business logic that does need to run in the browsers into <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers\">Web Workers</a>. For example, business logic that is invoked in response to user interactions. The code that runs in the browser’s main thread is mostly dedicated to the actual rendering operations. Because Web Workers execute their JavaScript code off of the main thread, they don’t block event handling, <strong>enabling the browser to quickly respond</strong> to user interactions and other events.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of code that runs in Web Workers include the business logic of various vertical solutions such as e-commerce and bookings. Sending requests to backend services is mostly done from Web Workers, and the responses are parsed, stored and managed in the Web Workers as well. As a result, using Web Workers can reduce blocking and improve the FID metric significantly, providing better responsiveness in general. In lab measurements, this improved TBT measurements.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"\n  \n    break-out article__image\n  \n  \n  \">\n  \n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fc51a983-801b-48d9-8267-e3910f1a8f1c/4-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png\">\n    \n    <img\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      decoding=\"async\"\n      importance=\"low\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"800\"\n\t\t\theight=\"382\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsrcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fc51a983-801b-48d9-8267-e3910f1a8f1c/4-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 400w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fc51a983-801b-48d9-8267-e3910f1a8f1c/4-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 800w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fc51a983-801b-48d9-8267-e3910f1a8f1c/4-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 1200w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fc51a983-801b-48d9-8267-e3910f1a8f1c/4-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 1600w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fc51a983-801b-48d9-8267-e3910f1a8f1c/4-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 2000w\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fc51a983-801b-48d9-8267-e3910f1a8f1c/4-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsizes=\"100vw\"\n\t\t\talt=\"FID metric improvements due to moving computations to backend and to Web Workers, especially on mobile devices, which often have slower CPUs but are multi-core.\"\n\t\t/>\n    \n    </a>\n  \n\n  \n    <figcaption class=\"op-vertical-bottom\">\n      FID metric improvements due to moving computations to backend and to Web Workers, especially on mobile devices, which often have slower CPUs but are multi-core.

Over the past decade the median amount of bytes of images downloaded by websites, according to the Google CrUX database, has <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images#bytesImg\">increased more than eightfold</a>!</p>\n\n<p>This is more than the median improvement in network speeds during the same period, which results in slower loading times. Additionally, our RUM data (field measurements) shows that for almost ¾ of Wix sessions the LCP element is an image. All of this highlights the need to deliver images to the browsers as efficiently as possible and to quickly display the images that are in a webpage’s initially visible viewport area.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, it is crucial to deliver the highest quality of images possible in order to provide an engaging and delightful user experience. This means that improving performance by noticeably degrading visual experience is almost always out of the question. The performance enhancements we implement need to preserve the original quality of images used, unless explicitly specified otherwise by the user.</p>\n\n<p>One technique for improving media-related performance is optimizing the delivery process. This means downloading required media resources as quickly as possible. In order to achieve this for Wix websites, we use a CDN to deliver the media content, as we do with other resources such as the HTML itself. And by specifying a lengthy caching duration in the HTTP response header, we allow images to be cached by browsers as well. This can improve the loading speed for repeat visits to the same page significantly by completely avoiding downloading the images over the network again.</p>\n\n<p>Another technique for improving performance is to deliver the required image information more efficiently by reducing the number of bytes that need to be downloaded while preserving the desired image quality. One method to achieve this is to use a modern image format such as <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/webp\">WebP</a>. Images encoded as WebP are generally 25% to 35% smaller than equivalent images encoded as PNG or JPG. Images uploaded to Wix are automatically converted to WebP before being delivered to <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/webp\">browsers that support this format</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Very often images need to be resized, cropped, or otherwise manipulated when displayed within a webpage. This manipulation can be performed inside the browser using CSS, but this usually means that more data needs to be downloaded than is actually used. For example, all the pixels of an image that have been cropped out aren’t actually needed but are still delivered. We also take into account viewport size and resolution, and display pixel depth, to optimize the image size. For Wix sites, we perform these manipulations on the server-side <strong>before</strong> the images are downloaded, this way we can ensure that only the pixels that are actually required are transmitted over the network. On the servers, we employ AI and ML models to generate resized images at the best quality possible.</p>\n\n<p>Yet another technique that is used for reducing the amount of image data that needs to be downloaded upfront is <a href=\"https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/\">lazy loading images</a>. This means not loading images that are wholly outside the visible viewport until they are about to scroll in. Deferring image download in this way, and even avoiding it completely (if a visitor never scrolls to that part of the page), reduces network contention for resources that are already required as soon as the page loads, such as an LCP image. Wix websites automatically utilize lazy loading for images, and for various other types of resources as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"\n  \n    break-out article__image\n  \n  \n  \">\n  \n    <a href=\"https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/927fe8b2-0ecf-4310-92dd-268941ad6d55/3-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png\">\n    \n    <img\n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      decoding=\"async\"\n      importance=\"low\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"800\"\n\t\t\theight=\"511\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsrcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/927fe8b2-0ecf-4310-92dd-268941ad6d55/3-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 400w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_800/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/927fe8b2-0ecf-4310-92dd-268941ad6d55/3-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 800w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1200/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/927fe8b2-0ecf-4310-92dd-268941ad6d55/3-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 1200w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_1600/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/927fe8b2-0ecf-4310-92dd-268941ad6d55/3-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 1600w,\n\t\t\t        https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_2000/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/927fe8b2-0ecf-4310-92dd-268941ad6d55/3-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png 2000w\"\n\t\t\tsrc=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/927fe8b2-0ecf-4310-92dd-268941ad6d55/3-improving-performance-wix-websites-case-study.png\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tsizes=\"100vw\"\n\t\t\talt=\"Median amount of image data downloaded per Wix session by KB.\"\n\t\t/>\n    \n    </a>\n  \n\n  \n    <figcaption class=\"op-vertical-bottom\">\n      Median amount of image data downloaded per Wix session by KB.

The result of all these enhancements is a dramatic increase in the percentage of Wix websites that get a good score for all three CWVs compared to a year ago. But performance is a journey, not a destination, and we still have many more action items and future plans for improving websites’ speed. To that end, we are investigating new browser capabilities as well as additional changes to our own infrastructure. The performance budgets and monitoring that we have implemented provide safeguards that these changes provide actual benefits.</p>\n\n<p>New media formats are being introduced that have the potential to reduce download sizes even more while retaining image quality. We are currently investigating <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/modern-image-formats-avif-webp/#avif\">AVIF</a>, which looks to be especially promising for photographic images that can use lossy compression. In such scenarios, AVIF can provide significantly reduced download sizes even compared to WebP, while retaining image quality. AVIF also supports progressive rendering which may improve perceived performance and user experience, especially on slower connections, but currently won’t provide any benefits for CWV.</p>\n\n<p>Another promising browser innovation that we are researching is the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-visibility\">content-visibility CSS property</a>. This property enables the browser to skip the effort of rendering an HTML element until it’s actually needed. In particular, when <code>content-visibility:auto</code> setting is applied to an element that is off-screen its descendants are not rendered. This enables the browser to skip most of the rendering work, such as styling and layout of the element’s subtree.</p>\n\n<p>This is especially desirable for many Wix pages that tend to be lengthy and content-rich. In particular, Wix’s new EditorX responsive sites editor support sophisticated grid and flexbox layouts that can be expensive for the browser to render, so that avoiding unnecessary rendering operations is especially desirable. Unfortunately, this property is currently only supported in Chromium-based browsers. Also, it’s challenging to implement this functionality in such a way that no Wix website is ever adversely affected in terms of its visual appearance or behavior.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/priority-hints\">Priority Hints</a> is an upcoming browser feature that we are also investigating, which promises to improve performance by providing greater control over when and how browsers download resources. This feature will inform browsers about which resources are more urgent and should be downloaded ahead of other resources. For example, a foreground image could be assigned a higher priority than a background image since it’s more likely to contain significant content. On the other hand, if applied incorrectly, priority hints can actually degrade download speed, and hence also CWV scores. Priority hints are currently undergoing Origin Trial in Chrome.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to enhancing Wix’s own infrastructure, we’re also working on providing better tooling for our users so that they can design and implement faster websites. Since Wix is highly customizable, users have the freedom and flexibility to create both fast and slow websites on our platform, depending on the decisions they make while building these sites. Our goal is to inform users about the performance of their decisions so that they can make appropriate choices.

            "\n<p>Apple Music has this &#8220;Spatial Audio&#8221; feature where the direction of the music in your headphones is based on the location of the device. It&#8217;s tough to explain just how neat it is. But that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m here to talk about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I opened up the Apple Music app and saw a featured playlist of hit songs that support Spatial Audio. The cover for it is this brightly-colored pink container that holds a bunch of boxes stacked one on top of another. The boxes animate in one at a time, fading in at the center of the container, then fading out as it scales to the size of the container. Like an infinite loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-357565\"></span>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"860\" height=\"290\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/apple-music-animation.gif?resize=860%2C290&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Animated GIF showing the Apple Music UI we are recreating.

I knew I had to re-create it in CSS. So I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_oNeRzLb\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/oNeRzLb?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=oNeRzLb&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed oNeRzLb\" title=\"CodePen Embed oNeRzLb\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it works&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-markup\">The markup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with the HTML. There&#8217;s obviously a container we need to define, plus however many boxes we want to animate. I went with an even 10 boxes in the container.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">&lt;div class=\"container\">\n  &lt;div class=\"box\">&lt;/div>\n  &lt;div class=\"box\">&lt;/div>\n  &lt;div class=\"box\">&lt;/div>\n  &lt;!-- etc. -->\n&lt;/div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s literally it for HTML. We are free to jump right into the CSS!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-styling-the-container\">Styling the container</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing too fancy here. I measured approximate dimensions based on what I saw in Apple Music, which happened to be <code>315px</code> × <code>385px</code>. then I took a screenshot of the cover and dropped it into my image editing app to get the lightest possible color, which is around the outside edges of the container. My color picker landed on <code>#eb5bec</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.container {\n  background-color: #eb5bec;\n  height: 315px;\n  width: 385px;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As I was doing this, I knew I would probably want this to be a grid container to align the boxes and any other elements in the center. I also figured that the boxes themselves would start from the center of the container and stack on top of one another, meaning there will be some absolute positioning. That also means the container ought to have relative positioning to reign them in.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"4\"><code markup=\"tt\">.container {\n  background-color: #eb5bec;\n  height: 315px;\n  position: relative;\n  width: 385px;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And since we want the boxes to start from the center, we can reach for grid to help with that:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"3,5\"><code markup=\"tt\">.container {\n  background-color: #eb5bec;\n  display: grid;\n  height: 315px;\n  place-items: center;\n  position: relative;\n  width: 385px;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If the boxes in the container are growing outward, then there&#8217;s a chance that they could expand beyond the container. Better hide any possible overflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"4\"><code markup=\"tt\">.container {\n  background-color: #eb5bec;\n  height: 315px;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  position: relative;\n  width: 385px;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I also noticed some rounded corners on it, so let&#8217;s drop that in while we&#8217;re here.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"3\"><code markup=\"tt\">.container {\n  background-color: #eb5bec;\n  border-radius: 16px;\n  height: 315px;\n  position: relative;\n  width: 385px;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, so good!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_oNeRzwL\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/oNeRzwL?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=oNeRzwL&amp;default-tab=css,result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed oNeRzwL\" title=\"CodePen Embed oNeRzwL\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Styling the boxes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have 10 <code>.box</code> elements in the markup and we want them stacked on top of one another. I started with some absolute positioning, then sized them at <code>100px</code> square. Then I did the same thing with my image editing app to find the darkest color value of a box, which was <code>#471e45</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.box {\n  background: #471e45;\n  height: 100px;\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 100px;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The boxes seem to fade out as they grow. That allows one box to be seen through the other, so let&#8217;s make them opaque to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"4\"><code markup=\"tt\">.box {\n  background: #471e45;\n  height: 100px;\n  opacity: 0.5;\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 100px;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool, cool. We&#8217;re unable to see all the boxes as they&#8217;re stacked on top of one another, but we&#8217;re making progress!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_XWawjBJ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/XWawjBJ?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=XWawjBJ&amp;default-tab=css,result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed XWawjBJ\" title=\"CodePen Embed XWawjBJ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Creating the animation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to write some <code>@keyframe</code>s?

We don&#8217;t even need those percentages!</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@keyframes grow {\n  from {\n    /* do stuff */\n  }\n  to {\n    /* do stuff */\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, we want two things to happen from start to finish:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The boxes go from our starting opacity value of <code>0.5</code> to <code>0</code> (fully transparent).</li><li>The boxes scale up to the edges of the container.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@keyframes grow {\n  from {\n    opacity: 0.5;\n    transform: scale(0);\n  }\n  to {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: scale(3.85);\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>How&#8217;d I land on scaling the boxes up by <code>3.85</code>? Our boxes are <code>100px</code> square and the container is <code>385px</code> tall. A value of <code>3.85</code> gets the boxes up to <code>385px</code> as they fade completely out which makes for a nice linear animation when we get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-applying-the-animation\">Applying the animation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to call the animation on our boxes. Just gotta make sure it moves in a liner timing function on an infinite basis so it&#8217;s like the Energizer Bunny and keeps going and going and going and going and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.box {\n  animation: grow 10s linear infinite; /* 10s = 10 boxes */\n  /* etc. */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives us the animation we want. But! The boxes are all moving at the same time, so all we see is one giant box growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_yLoWawm\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/yLoWawm?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=yLoWawm&amp;default-tab=css,result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed yLoWawm\" title=\"CodePen Embed yLoWawm\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve gotta stagger those little fellers. No loops in vanilla CSS, unfortunately, so we have to delay each box individually. We can start by setting a custom property for the delay, set it to one second, then redefine the custom property on each instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.box {\n  --delay: 1s;\n  \n  animation-delay: var(--delay);\n  /* same as before */\n}\n.box:nth-child(2) {\n  --delay: 2s;\n}\n.box:nth-child(3) {\n  --delay: 3s;\n}\n.box:nth-child(4) {\n  --delay: 4s;\n}\n.box:nth-child(5) {\n  --delay: 5s;\n}\n/* five more times... */</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Huzzah!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_VwzOKOM\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/VwzOKOM?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=VwzOKOM&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed VwzOKOM\" title=\"CodePen Embed VwzOKOM\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-keep-on-rockin\">Keep on rockin&#8217;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it! We just recreated the same sort of effect used by Apple Music. There are a few finishing touches we could plop in there, like the content and whatnot. Here&#8217;s my final version again:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_oNeRzLb\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/oNeRzLb?height=550&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=oNeRzLb&amp;default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed oNeRzLb\" title=\"CodePen Embed oNeRzLb\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\n"

A software engineer is not just someone who writes code all the time. More often than not, software developers hail from different professional backgrounds and career tracks, and are passionate about a lot of things. A portfolio exhibits the creative side of a software engineer who&#8217;s willing to invest time in explaining their work not only to the general public, but to recruiters, hiring managers, and other engineers.</strong> </p>\n<h2 id=\"whataportfolioisandwhyyouneedone\">What a Portfolio Is, and Why You Need One</h2>\n<p>A portfolio is more than just a resume. It&#8217;s a portal into your world of creativity and engineering prowess. Just like a company advertises its brand through a portfolio for its services and products, you can too as a software engineer. </p>\n<p>A portfolio documents items that are not normally in a resume. As a software engineer, you are what you do. A picture is to a photographer as a project is to an engineer. </p>\n<p>Your resume may speak of skills that you currently possess, but without projects to apply them to, they&#8217;re just hash tags and labels. A portfolio organizes the information normally found in a resume based on projects and marketable skills.</p>\n<p>To keep up with rapid technology changes, you should be current with your skills. Skills are often related to the projects you accomplish at work or in your own time. A resume can be boring if it&#8217;s just plain text. A portfolio can document your projects, highlight the skills relevant to those projects, and link to live demos, video walkthroughs, and source code repositories.</p>\n<p>Like a resume, a portfolio can be printable, but it&#8217;s best to be in the format of an interactive website so that it can be searchable on the Web and always up to date with your latest projects.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve encountered challenges in a project and successfully solved them, document the project in a portfolio. Doing so will not only prove your technical accomplishments, but will also highlight your problem-solving skills and persistence.</p>\n<p>During a job interview, a portfolio can be a conversation piece with recruiters, hiring managers, and other engineers. Speaking about your portfolio might just leave an indelible impression on your future boss for years to come.</p>\n<h2 id=\"planningaportfolio\">Planning a Portfolio</h2>\n<p>Like any other web development project, your portfolio website can be implemented in many different ways.  Consider asking these questions while planning your portfolio project.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Static or dynamic?</strong> Will your website be a statically generated set of pages or a dynamic one with a database?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Single-page or multi-page?</strong> Will your portfolio website appear as a single-page application or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application\">SPA</a>, or a multi-page website?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Responsive?</strong> Will your portfolio website be portable across multiple browsers, platforms, and devices? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s your budget?</strong> Are you looking to spend a considerable amount of time and money to make your portfolio website? </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Answering these questions will help you decide where to build and host your portfolio.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsinaportfolio\">What&#8217;s in a Portfolio</h2>\n<p>Creating a portfolio website is like writing an article. First, you need to create an outline of what you want to include in your portfolio website.  Here are some recommendations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutsection\">About Section</h3>\n<p>Since a portfolio website is all about you and your accomplishments, remember to introduce yourself in a friendly but professional manner. Besides your name and role(s), try to add an original tag line or quote that you live by that conveys your personality. Add a short list of goals for your next project or role if you have one to match what your prospective client or recruiter is looking for. Although not necessary, you can also describe your personal interests.</p>\n<p>The image below shows that About page of <a href=\"https://andrewborstein.com/\">Andrew Borstein</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630994864borstein.jpg\" alt=\"The About page of Andrew Borstein\" width=\"\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-203510\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630994864borstein.jpg 1254w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630994864borstein-300x185.jpg 300w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630994864borstein-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630994864borstein-768x475.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1254px) 100vw, 1254px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"projects\">Projects</h3>\n<p>The crux of your portfolio website is your projects. Step back and take a look at your past achievements and select several projects you&#8217;re proud to showcase. For each project, you can do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organize all the information needed to describe a project in terms of words, pictures, videos, and source code, if available. </li>\n<li>Arrange your projects in a grid or list presentation. </li>\n<li>Label or tag the skills involved in creating the project to include programming languages, environments, frameworks, and deployment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of that from the portfolio of <a href=\"https://caferati.me/\">Rafael Cafarati</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630994916cafarati.jpg\" alt=\"Projects organized on the portfolio site of Rafael Cafarati\" width=\"\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-203512\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630994916cafarati.jpg 929w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630994916cafarati-300x182.jpg 300w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630994916cafarati-768x465.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"contactpage\">Contact Page</h3>\n<p>Provide enough contact information to reach you either by email, phone, or a web form.

We&#8217;ll use a range of API methods that Deno provides to read and write to the file system.</strong></p>\n<p>In our last installment, we used Deno to <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-fetch-data-third-party-api/\">build a command-line tool to make requests to a third-party API</a>. In this article, we&#8217;re going to leave the network to one side and build a tool that lets you search the file system for text in files and folders within your current directory — similar to tools like <code>grep</code>. </p>\n<p><em>Note: we&#8217;re not building a tool that will be as optimized and efficient as <code>grep</code>, nor are we aiming to replace it! The aim of building a tool like this is to get familiar with Deno&#8217;s file system APIs.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"installingdeno\">Installing Deno</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to assume that you&#8217;ve got Deno up and running on your machine locally. You can check the <a href=\"https://deno.land/#installation\">Deno website</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-fetch-data-third-party-api/\">previous article</a> for more detailed installation instructions and also to get information on how to add Deno support to your editor of choice.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, the latest stable version of Deno is <strong>1.10.2</strong>, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using in this article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"settingupournewcommandwithyargs\">Setting Up Our New Command with Yargs</h2>\n<p>As in the previous article, we&#8217;ll use <a href=\"https://deno.land/x/yargs@v17.0.1-deno\">Yargs</a> to build the interface that our users can use to execute our tool. Let&#8217;s create <code>index.ts</code> and populate it with the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">import yargs from \"https://deno.land/x/yargs@v17.0.1-deno/deno.ts\";\r\n\r\ninterface Yargs&lt;ArgvReturnType&gt; {\r\n  describe: (param: string, description: string) =&gt; Yargs&lt;ArgvReturnType&gt;;\r\n  demandOption: (required: string[]) =&gt; Yargs&lt;ArgvReturnType&gt;;\r\n  argv: ArgvReturnType;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface UserArguments {\r\n  text: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst userArguments: UserArguments =\r\n  (yargs(Deno.args) as unknown as Yargs&lt;UserArguments&gt;)\r\n    .describe(\"text\", \"the text to search for within the current directory\")\r\n    .demandOption([\"text\"])\r\n    .argv;\r\n\r\nconsole.log(userArguments);\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>There&#8217;s a fair bit going on here that&#8217;s worth pointing out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We install Yargs by pointing to its path on the Deno repository. I explicitly use a precise version number to make sure we always get that version, so that we don&#8217;t end up using whatever happens to be the latest version when the script runs.</li>\n<li>At the time of writing, the Deno + TypeScript experience for Yargs isn&#8217;t great, so I&#8217;ve created my own interface and used that to provide some type safety.</li>\n<li><code>UserArguments</code> contains all the inputs we&#8217;ll ask the user for. For now, we&#8217;re only going to ask for <code>text</code>, but in future we could expand this to provide a list of files to search for, rather than assuming the current directory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can run this with <code>deno run index.ts</code> and see our Yargs output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ deno run index.ts\r\nCheck file:///home/jack/git/deno-file-search/index.ts\r\nOptions:\r\n  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]\r\n  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]\r\n  --text     the text to search for within the current directory      [required]\r\n\r\nMissing required argument: text\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to get implementing!</p>\n<h2 id=\"listingfiles\">Listing Files</h2>\n<p>Before we can start searching for text in a given file, we need to generate a list of directories and files to search within. Deno provides <a href=\"https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.readDir\"><code>Deno.readdir</code></a>, which is part of the &#8220;built-ins&#8221; library, meaning you don&#8217;t have to import it. It&#8217;s available for you on the global namespace.</p>\n<p><code>Deno.readdir</code> is asynchronous and returns a list of files and folders in the current directory. It returns these items as an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/asyncIterator\"><code>AsyncIterator</code></a>, which means we have to use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await…of\"><code>for await ... of</code></a> loop to get at the results:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">for await (const fileOrFolder of Deno.readDir(Deno.cwd())) {\r\n  console.log(fileOrFolder);\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code will read from the current working directory (which <code>Deno.cwd()</code> gives us) and log each result. However, if you try to run the script now, you&#8217;ll get an error:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ deno run index.ts --text='foo'\r\nerror: Uncaught PermissionDenied: Requires read access to &lt;CWD&gt;, run again with the --allow-read flag\r\nfor await (const fileOrFolder of Deno.readDir(Deno.cwd())) {\r\n                                                   ^\r\n    at deno:core/core.js:86:46\r\n    at unwrapOpResult (deno:core/core.js:106:13)\r\n    at Object.opSync (deno:core/core.js:120:12)\r\n    at Object.cwd (deno:runtime/js/30_fs.js:57:17)\r\n    at file:///home/jack/git/deno-file-search/index.ts:19:52\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Remember that Deno requires all scripts to be explicitly given permissions to read from the file system. In our case, the <code>--allow-read</code> flag will enable our code to run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">~/$ deno run --allow-read index.ts --text='foo'\r\n{ name: \".git\", isFile: false, isDirectory: true, isSymlink: false }\r\n{ name: \".vscode\", isFile: false, isDirectory: true, isSymlink: false }\r\n{ name: \"index.ts\", isFile: true, isDirectory: false, isSymlink: false }\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, I&#8217;m running the script in the directory where I&#8217;m building our tool, so it finds the TS source code, the <code>.git</code> repository and the <code>.vscode</code> folder. Let&#8217;s start writing some functions to recursively navigate this structure, as we need to find all the files within the directory, not just the top level ones. Additionally, we can add some common ignores. I don&#8217;t think anyone will want the script to search the entire <code>.git</code> folder!</p>\n<p>In the code below, we&#8217;ve created the <code>getFilesList</code> function, which takes a directory and returns all files in that directory. If it encounters a directory, it will recursively call itself to find any nested files, and return the result:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">const IGNORED_DIRECTORIES = new Set([\".git\"]);\r\n\r\nasync function getFilesList(\r\n  directory: string,\r\n): Promise&lt;string[]&gt; {\r\n  const foundFiles: string[] = [];\r\n  for await (const fileOrFolder of Deno.readDir(directory)) {\r\n    if (fileOrFolder.isDirectory) {\r\n      if (IGNORED_DIRECTORIES.has(fileOrFolder.name)) {\r\n        // Skip this folder, it's in the ignore list.\r\n        continue;\r\n      }\r\n      // If it's not ignored, recurse and search this folder for files.\r\n      const nestedFiles = await getFilesList(\r\n        `${directory}/${fileOrFolder.name}`,\r\n      );\r\n      foundFiles.push(...nestedFiles);\r\n    } else {\r\n      // We found a file, so store it.\r\n      foundFiles.push(`${directory}/${fileOrFolder.name}`);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return foundFiles;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can then use this like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">const files = await getFilesList(Deno.cwd());\r\nconsole.log(files);\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We also get some output that looks good:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ deno run --allow-read index.ts --text='foo'\r\n[\r\n  \"/home/jack/git/deno-file-search/.vscode/settings.json\",\r\n  \"/home/jack/git/deno-file-search/index.ts\"\r\n]\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"usingthepathmodule\">Using the <code>path</code> Module</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re could now combine file paths with template strings like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">`${directory}/${fileOrFolder.name}`,\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>But it would be nicer to do this using Deno&#8217;s <code>path</code> module. This module is one of the modules that Deno provides as part of its standard library (much like Node does with its <code>path</code> module), and if you&#8217;ve used Node&#8217;s <code>path</code> module the code will look very similar. At the time of writing, the latest version of the <code>std</code> library Deno provides is <code>0.97.0</code>, and we import the <code>path</code> module from the <code>mod.ts</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">import * as path from \"https://deno.land/std@0.97.0/path/mod.ts\";\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>mod.ts</code> is always the entrypoint when importing Deno&#8217;s standard modules. The documentation for this module <a href=\"https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std@0.97.0/path/mod.ts\">lives on the Deno site</a> and lists <code>path.join</code>, which will take multiple paths and join them into one path. Let&#8217;s import and use that function rather than manually combining them:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">// import added to the top of our script\r\nimport yargs from \"https://deno.land/x/yargs@v17.0.1-deno/deno.ts\";\r\nimport * as path from \"https://deno.land/std@0.97.0/path/mod.ts\";\r\n\r\n// update our usages of the function:\r\nasync function getFilesList(\r\n  directory: string,\r\n): Promise&lt;string[]&gt; {\r\n  const foundFiles: string[] = [];\r\n  for await (const fileOrFolder of Deno.readDir(directory)) {\r\n    if (fileOrFolder.isDirectory) {\r\n      if (IGNORED_DIRECTORIES.has(fileOrFolder.name)) {\r\n        // Skip this folder, it's in the ignore list.\r\n        continue;\r\n      }\r\n      // If it's not ignored, recurse and search this folder for files.\r\n      const nestedFiles = await getFilesList(\r\n        path.join(directory, fileOrFolder.name),\r\n      );\r\n      foundFiles.push(...nestedFiles);\r\n    } else {\r\n      // We found a file, so store it.\r\n      foundFiles.push(path.join(directory, fileOrFolder.name));\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return foundFiles;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>When using the standard library, it&#8217;s vital that you remember to pin to a specific version. Without doing so, your code will always load the latest version, even if that contains changes that will break your code. <a href=\"https://deno.land/manual/standard_library\">The Deno docs on the standard library</a> go into this further, and I recommend giving that page a read.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-file-system/?utm_source=rss\">Working with the File System in Deno</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Before “design handoff” was even a term, handing over designs was a complicated, frustrating, and often disastrous task. Way back when, Adobe Photoshop was the only tool available for designing user interfaces, and design handoff tools and/or features didn’t exist. Converting a design to code was referred to as “slicing a PSD”. Oh, the days.</p>\n<p>Slicing a PSD (a Photoshop document) was the developer’s responsibility, which was very frustrating, because developers understandably didn’t want to work with design tools. Designers would manually document design specs to make things clearer, but this still resulted in visual/functional inconsistencies and heated discussions with developers. I’m still having nightmares. (If you&#8217;d like to share in my nightmares, <em><a href=\"https://invisionapp.com/inside-design/6-design-dev-memes/\">here&#8217;s a nice collection of memes for you to explore</a>.</em>)</p>\n<h3 id=\"designhandofftoday\">Design handoff today</h3>\n<p>Nowadays, there’s an abundance of UI tools sporting design handoff features and even tools that are wholly dedicated to handoff, and which help designers and developers translate design to code, house design files, maintain consistency between design elements, and facilitate good designer-developer collaboration.</p>\n<p>Modernized designers and developers recognize the design handoff process as a key development process, whether building a design system or a product from scratch. In fact, UI design tools such as Figma offer handoff and design system features side by side.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdodesignhandofftoolsactuallydo\">What Do Design Handoff Tools Actually Do?</h2>\n<p>Handoff tools help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>designers to ready their designs for inspection</li>\n<li>developers to inspect and translate designs to code</li>\n<li>designers and developers to collaborate and communicate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without design handoff, developers are left with only one alternative: <em>guessing</em>. Guessing often results in visual and functional inaccuracies — such as the wrong colors being used or interactions behaving oddly. In turn, this impacts the user’s experience and sends designers into a nuclear meltdown.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at five of the best design handoff tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"figmahttpsfigmacommostused\"><a href=\"https://figma.com/\">Figma</a> (most used)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Platforms: Web, macOS, Linux, Windows</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://figma.com/pricing/\">Pricing</a>: $0/user/month, $12/user/month, $45/user/month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While not as advanced as Zeplin in terms of how many code languages are supported, Figma translates design styles to CSS (for web), Swift (for iOS/macOS/iPadOS), and XML (for Android). However, this should cover the majority of design handoffs anyway.</p>\n<p>Alternative design handoff tools can be installed as Figma Plugins for when designs need to be translated to Sass, Less, Stylus, React Native code, and more.</p>\n<p>Image assets can be exported or copied to the clipboard in SVG or PNG format, all at once or singularly, in any resolution.</p>\n<p>If collaborators have something to say (or ask) about the design, they can communicate clearly and openly using contextual comments, which aids collaboration and ensures that everybody is on board with how the design should look, feel, and function.</p>\n<p>Figma is not only the most used tool for design handoff, but also for user flows, user interfaces, interactive prototypes, design systems, <em>and</em> version control (according to the <a href=\"https://uxtools.co/survey-2020/#toolkit\">2020 Design Tools Survey</a>). While Zeplin is the highest-rated handoff tool due to the fact that it supports more code languages, Figma isn’t too far behind, as it&#8217;s multi-functional and facilitates a lot more than handoff.</p>\n<p>All in all, I would choose Figma (as most teams do) until I needed to hand off designs using an unsupported code language, in which case Zeplin makes a more-than-ideal secondary option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1637031238figma.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Figma home page\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"zeplinhttpszepliniohighestrated\"><a href=\"https://zeplin.io/\">Zeplin</a> (highest rated)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Platforms: Web, macOS, Windows</li>\n<li>Import from: Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD, Photoshop</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://zeplin.io/pricing\">Pricing</a>: $0/user/month, $6/user/month, $12/user/month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Zeplin supports more code languages than Figma does (React Native, Sass, Less, Stylus, etc., in addition to the standard Swift, XML, and CSS). It’s also cheaper than Figma-like tools, though this is because Figma-like tools are multi-functional and cover much more of the UI design workflow. Zeplin is the highest-rated design handoff tool (according to the 2020 Design Tools Survey), so some designers tend to overlook this downside.</p>\n<p>In order to use Zeplin, you’ll need to create designs using Photoshop, Adobe XD, Sketch, or Figma first, so it’s totally understandable that some designers would rather keep their UI design workflow contained to a single tool, and this is likely why Figma is used more often than Zeplin for handoff.</p>\n<p>Functionality-wise, Zeplin does everything you’d expect a handoff tool to do (and does it fairly well). It exports image assets as a variety of formats and in various resolutions, translates design styles to code, and facilitates communication.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1637031897zeplin.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Zeplin home page\" /></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/best-design-handoff-tools/?utm_source=rss\">The 5 Best Design Handoff Tools in 2021</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

With the rising popularity of watching US Netflix in other countries, many less computer-savvy people have found themselves learning about VPNs to view this geo-blocked content.</p>\n<p>While that&#8217;s a great use of a VPN, there are still tons of other use cases that people aren&#8217;t even aware of. The ability to change your geolocation so easily can be a total game changer when it comes to your online activities, and some of these things can improve your internet connection or even save you money.</p>\n<p><em>Before we get started, if you&#8217;re new to VPNs, check out “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/vpns-what-they-are-why-you-need-one/\">VPNs: What They Are, and Why You Need One</a>”. And if you&#8217;re wondering which VPN to choose, check out “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/best-vpns-for-developers/\">The Best VPNs for Developers</a>”.</em></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the different things you can do with a VPN that you probably didn&#8217;t know about.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1avoidtrafficshaping\">1. Avoid Traffic Shaping</h2>\n<p>Have you ever felt your internet slow down for no apparent reason? There can be a few reasons for this, but one reason is that ISPs use traffic shaping to throttle down your connection speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Traffic shaping</strong> is a technique used by ISPs to sort the different types of traffic on their network in order to prioritize certain types of traffic. This means that, as they sort the type of traffic coming from you, they decide if they want to slow you down.</p>\n<p>Application-based shaping is the most common form of traffic shaping, and we typically experience this every day without even knowing it. With application-based shaping, ISPs will determine which types of applications deserve priority over others. </p>\n<p>While many people are aware of potential throttling if they exceed data caps, a lot of people don&#8217;t know that some of their traffic is slowed down just simply based on the type of traffic it is.</p>\n<p>A known favorite for ISPs to target with throttling is gaming, and most gamers aren&#8217;t even aware that their ISPs are throttling down their connection speeds! With so many people gaming on the Internet, it&#8217;s an easy target for ISPs because it can have a significant boost on the overall performance of the network if they save some bandwidth here.</p>\n<p>Many apps use encryption to get around traffic shaping to improve their performance, and this is where the power of a VPN begins to shine! VPNs offer an encrypted connection that reroutes your traffic. The encrypted data circumvents the traffic shaping and makes your data harder to decipher.</p>\n<p>This, in turn, prevents connection throttling from your ISP, because they can&#8217;t figure out what type of traffic is being used by your network.</p>\n<p>If you care about having the best connection speeds possible when playing games online, make sure you use a high-quality VPN to use your internet connection unthrottled.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2accessstreamingappsoninflightinternet\">2. Access Streaming Apps On Inflight Internet</h2>\n<p>Have you ever been on a plane and tried to use a streaming app on the inflight internet? You may have noticed that video streaming apps like Netflix and YouTube are blocked. This is because video streaming apps require a fair amount of bandwidth to be able to play the videos you want to watch.</p>\n<p>Airlines end up in a dilemma because they want their customers to have access to Wi-Fi while flying, but if everyone wanted to watch Netflix or YouTube, there simply wouldn&#8217;t be enough bandwidth to go around. This is why, most of the time, there are measures put in place to block apps like Netflix and YouTube. This is inconvenient, since most people using the internet connection on a plane probably want to watch some videos to kill time.</p>\n<p>Once again, VPNs are your best friend in this situation! By utilizing a VPN when connected to an inflight internet service, you&#8217;re routing your traffic around their network, and you&#8217;ll be able to watch whatever you want on the connection.</p>\n<p>Ensuring you have a VPN on your device before flying can allow you to kick back and stream your favorite content while everybody else is stuck watching the inflight movie!</p>\n<p>(<em>Editor&#8217;s note: some streaming services allow you to download movies and other content to your device for watching offline later, which is another option to consider!</em>)</p>\n<h2 id=\"3viewliveeventswithdifferentcommentary\">3. View Live Events with Different Commentary</h2>\n<p>Commentary can really make or break the viewing experience, especially when it comes to sports.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking for commentary in another language or feel that commentary from another country is better, a VPN will allow you to view sporting events with commentary of your choosing.</p>\n<p>Typically, when you&#8217;re watching a stream of an event that&#8217;s being viewed internationally, the geolocation that you connect with will determine the commentary you receive. It makes sense that someone from Germany who&#8217;s watching a football match will want German commentary, but if you&#8217;re an English speaker who&#8217;s in Germany, you might want English commentary.</p>\n<p>By running a VPN before streaming the event, you can select a server from the UK. This changes your geolocation in the eyes of the website or app, and you&#8217;ll be served up commentary from the UK. This trick is especially useful for sports fans who do a lot of traveling abroad.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/vpn-things-you-didnt-know/?utm_source=rss\">8 Things You Didn’t Know a VPN Can Do</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll cover the following Magento 2 translation topics:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>what internationalization is, and why it&#8217;s important</li>\n<li>how we can add more languages in Magento 2</li>\n<li>how to translate CMS content, including pages</li>\n<li>how to internationalize modules and themes including adding translations, changing assets and making changes to the styles of the module or theme</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Magento 2 is one of the most popular ecommerce platforms currently available. It offers tons of out-of-the-box features and tight security. Other than the built-in modules, with Magento 2 you can create your own modules and themes to create custom functionalities and design that fits your or your client&#8217;s needs.</p>\n<p><em>This tutorial assumes you already have Magento 2 installed and working. If not, please follow the guideline from <a href=\"https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/composer.html\">Magento 2&#8217;s official documentation</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"whyinternationalization\">Why Internationalization</h2>\n<p>Internationalization (often abbreviated as i18n) includes both translating your website and changing the design or style of the website based on the language chosen. Depending on your project and the programming language or framework you work with, it can be done in various ways, but there are always tools to make it easier.</p>\n<p>Internationalization attracts more users to your website, as adding different languages caters to users of different nationalities or different parts of the world.</p>\n<p>This is especially important with ecommerce. One way to make sure your store understands its users and is able to convert them to customers is to provide more languages, making the store available globally.</p>\n<h2 id=\"magento2websitestructure\">Magento 2 Website Structure</h2>\n<p>Before we get into how we can add a language in Magento 2, let&#8217;s go over how a Magento 2 website is structured first.</p>\n<p>In Magento 2, you need at least one website. In that website, you can create several stores but you also need at least one. Then, inside each store you need at least one store view.</p>\n<p>By default, every Magento 2 installation will have a website, a store in the website, and a store view in that store.</p>\n<p>The website is only used to organize multiple stores under the same website. Think of it as a group.</p>\n<p>The store is used to specify which categories are sold in the store, which ultimately means which products are sold in the store. For example, you can have one website split into two stores — one for men&#8217;s clothes and one for women&#8217;s clothes.</p>\n<p>And finally, we have the store view which belongs to a store. Store views are what a user actually sees. Store views can have their own theme, pages, products, and more.</p>\n<p>With this structure, you are able to separate your ecommerce website into different sections or even different websites. For example, you can have all your products in the same Magento instance, but split these products into different websites, or different stores inside the website.</p>\n<p>This separation also allows you to set different settings for different websites, stores or store views in your Magento instance. You can change settings for an entire website, which will affect all of the stores in it and subsequently all store views in these stores.</p>\n<p>You can also change settings for a store inside a website, which will change the settings for only this store and its store views, without affecting other stores or the main website.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can change settings for store views, which would not affect their parent store or parent website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addinglanguagesinmagento2\">Adding Languages in Magento 2</h2>\n<p>Languages are dependent on store views. Each store view can have its own language. So, when you want to add a new language, you actually need to add a new store view having a different language.</p>\n<p>The store view can have the same settings as its parent store or website. So there&#8217;s no need for extra configuration unless you need to have different settings for that language.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addingastoreview\">Adding a Store View</h2>\n<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll see how to add a new store view in Magento 2 using the Admin panel, and how we can choose the language of that store view.</p>\n<h3 id=\"addanewstoreview\">Add a New Store View</h3>\n<p>First, go to your Magento 2 admin portal. The URL path should start with <code>/admin_</code>. However, it will probably have a different suffix which you&#8217;ve set during installation.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve gone to the admin panel and logged in, choose <em>Stores</em> from the sidebar, then <em>All Stores</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633635814Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-10.42.28-PM.png\" alt=\"Store in Menu\" /></p>\n<p>In this page, click on <em>Create Store View</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633635889Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-4.42.03-PM.png\" alt=\"Stores Page\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll then see a form to fill in. You&#8217;ll first have to choose the store this store view belongs to if you have multiple stores.</p>\n<p>Then, you need to enter the name of the store. Please note that the name is what the user will see on the front end of your website when choosing between stores. So, you can name it based on the language you&#8217;re adding.</p>\n<p>You also need to add the code for the new store. You can choose any code you want, but it would be helpful to set the code based on the language. For example, <code>en</code> for English.</p>\n<p>Finally, you&#8217;ll need to change the Status to <em>Enabled</em> to make sure the users see the store view.</p>\n<p>You can also choose the sort order. This is helpful if you&#8217;re adding a new language, but you want that language to be the default language a user sees when they go to your website. If so, you can change the sort order here by setting a number, with the lowest (meaning the highest in order) being 0.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633635954Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-4.53.28-PM.png\" alt=\"Store View Form\" /></p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re done, click on <em>Save Store View</em>, and your store view will be added.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633635984Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-4.53.43-PM.png\" alt=\"Saved Store View\" /></p>\n<p>You might need to clear the cache at this point. You can do that by clicking on <em>Stores</em> in the sidebar, then <em>Cache Management</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633636069Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-10.46.54-PM.png\" alt=\"Cache in Menu\" /></p>\n<p>Then, choose <em>Select All</em> from the dropdown and click on <em>Submit</em>. This will clear the cache.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633636108Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-4.56.43-PM.png\" alt=\"Clear Cache\" /></p>\n<p>Now, go to your website. Depending on your theme, you should see a dropdown in the header of the website allowing you to switch between store views.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633636146Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-4.54.18-PM.png\" alt=\"Languages Dropdown\" /></p>\n<p>Please note that this will look different based on your theme. The theme in the screenshot in Magento&#8217;s Luma theme, which comes installed by default in Magento 2.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choosealanguageforthestoreview\">Choose a language for the store view</h3>\n<p>Next, we&#8217;ll choose the language of the store view. To do that, on the admin panel click on <em>Stores</em> in the sidebar, then <em>Configuration</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633636214Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-4.54.54-PM.png\" alt=\"Configuration in Menu\" /></p>\n<p>Please note that on the admin portal, you&#8217;ll see a dropdown at the top left of almost every page with the label <em>Scope</em> that allows you to change the website, store, or store view. You use this when you want to change settings to a specific website, store, or store view rather than the default settings that will apply to all websites, stores, and store views.</p>\n<p>So, on the Configuration page, choose the store view you just created from the dropdown. You&#8217;ll be asked to confirm your action. Click <em>OK</em> in the pop up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633636252Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-4.55.49-PM.png\" alt=\"Store Views Dropdown\" /></p>\n<p>Then, choose <em>General</em> tab under the <em>General</em> section in the sidebar if it&#8217;s not already chosen. Open the collapsible with the title <em>Locale Options</em>. Under the collapsible, uncheck <em>Use Website</em> on the right of the first field, which should be <em>Locale</em>, then choose from the dropdown the language you&#8217;re adding.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633636307Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-4.56.04-PM.png\" alt=\"Change Locale\" /></p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we&#8217;re adding the Arabic language.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re done, click <em>Save Config</em> at the top right. This will change your website&#8217;s language. However, you&#8217;ll notice that nothing has changed when you open the store you just added. This is because we still need to add translations to the language we added, as well as change styling if necessary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installmagento2languagepacks\">Install Magento 2 Language Packs</h2>\n<p>Other than the strings and text you might add yourself in your own module, because strings in Magento 2 are common, there are free and open-source Magento 2 language packs that allow you to easily add translations to your Magento 2 website.</p>\n<p>You can find language packs on <a href=\"https://marketplace.magento.com/extensions/content-customizations/translations-localization.html?\">Magento&#8217;s Marketplace</a>, although most of them are not free.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-extensions/language-packs.html\">Mageplaza</a> offers a wide set of language packs you can install that are free and open source. They have 55 Magento 2 language packs that you can use for free.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll install their <a href=\"https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-arabic-language-pack.html\">Arabic Language pack</a>. You can choose any language pack; the process is the same for any language pack regardless of the language.</p>\n<p>If you choose a Magento 2 language pack from a different provider, the steps should also be the same unless your provider states different steps.</p>\n<p>Open your terminal and switch to the Magento project&#8217;s root directory. In that directory, run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">composer require mageplaza/magento-2-&lt;LANGUAGE&gt;-language-pack:dev-master mageplaza/module-smtp \r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Please note that you should replace <code>&lt;LANGUAGE&gt;</code> with the language you&#8217;re installing. In our case, it will be <code>arabic</code>. You can also find the name of the package by going to the GitHub page of the language (if you are downloading from Mageplaza) and checking the name of the repository.</p>\n<p>After that&#8217;s done, you can go on your website, choose your new language if it&#8217;s not already chosen, and you&#8217;ll see that the page is translated to that language.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633636419Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-5.45.28-PM.png\" alt=\"Magento 2 translation example\" /></p>\n<p>If the page isn&#8217;t translated, or there&#8217;s a problem with the styles of the page, then do the following.</p>\n<p>Run the following command to generate the static content for the new language added:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy ar_SA\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure to replace <code>ar_SA</code> with the language you&#8217;re adding. You&#8217;ll also need to add the option <code>-f</code> if your Magento 2 instance is set to developer mode.</p>\n<p>After that, execute the following commands to trigger reindexing and clear the cache:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">php bin/magento indexer:reindex\r\nphp bin/magento cache:clean\r\nphp bin/magento cache:flush\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/magento-2-translation-how-internationalization-works/?utm_source=rss\">Magento 2 Translation: How Internationalization Works</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

These questions can be un ique to yourself or be set up with inspiration from a brag document and a daily review. These will help you remember the things that you’ve done throughout the day and to analyze how you’ve felt and what occurred to make you feel that way.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisabragdocument\">What is a Brag Document?</h2>\n<p>Our brain is not the best tool for remembering things unless you’re blessed with a photographic memory. You can find yourself not remembering things you’ve done in the last week or month.</p>\n<p>A brag document is the ace up your sleeve when it comes to sitting in front of your manager for a review. Most of us work roughly about 2000 hours a year. How much of what you do, do you think your manager is aware of?</p>\n<p>There could be things you’re working on that are making big changes in the business, but they never get brought up with your manager. It’s these little things that get skipped over and not considered when it comes to review time.</p>\n<p>This is where a brag document comes in. To save you from having to use your not-so-good memory, why not receive an email every day that asks you what you’ve completed. This information is then stored in a Google sheet so you have complete records, from the smallest to the largest things you&#8217;ve managed to achieve at work.</p>\n<p>Then, when it comes down to your yearly review, you can easily show all the things you&#8217;ve achieved, which can give you the leverage you need to get that well-deserved pay rise. 😃</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisselfreviewing\">What Is Self Reviewing?</h2>\n<p>You’re looking to upgrade your car. You’ve had a motor for many years but it’s on its last legs, spurting black smoke and making clunking noises when you drive.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve spent some time doing research to make sure you&#8217;re buying the right car. After a long debate, you settle on a BMW. And as if out of nowhere, you see the same make and model everywhere, even though weeks ago <em>none</em> of them were on the road.</p>\n<p>This is called the <strong>Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon</strong>. It’s when something has been brought to your awareness and it appears to be everywhere. This is the effect that we’ll be trying to take advantage of with your self reviewing.</p>\n<p>If you ask yourself “What bad habit did I partake in today?”, it’ll make you think about anything you consider a bad habit, like eating a whole pack of cookies or doom-scrolling on social media. </p>\n<p>If we now do this for over a week, the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon starts to occur. You now become more conscious about these behaviors. Rather than this behavior happening without thinking, you’ll be able to spot when it happens because you’ve been writing about it every day. And then you can make an effort to stop that behavior.</p>\n<p>Self reviewing can also help you to analyze how your day went. Again, we have some questions that prompt us, such as “What did I enjoy doing?” or “What sucked the energy out of me?”</p>\n<p>These are questions that can help you spot patterns and then take action. If you find that you enjoy writing, then you can plan to do more. If you find that talking to a certain someone at work drains all your energy, you can try to speak to them as little as possible, or pick times of the day when you have enough energy to deal with them.</p>\n<p>With very little effort each day, you can start to collect important information, from the awesome work  you&#8217;ve been doing, to the habits that are invisible to you, and then make plans each week to improve your life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtosetupyourdailyemails\">How to Set Up Your Daily Emails</h2>\n<p>There are three things that we need to be able to set up daily emails:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a Zapier account</li>\n<li>a Google Drive account</li>\n<li>a set of questions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Zapier account will handle the automation: the sending of the questions, and the parsing of the data from the email.</p>\n<p>The Google Drive account is for setting up the Google Sheets where the data from email will be stored for reviewing our answers.</p>\n<p>The set of questions will be the information we want to gather.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, we need to set up an account on <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a> and make sure that we have a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive\">Google Drive</a> account.</p>\n<p>Once we&#8217;ve done that, we can get started. </p>\n<h2 id=\"sendingdailyemails\">Sending Daily Emails</h2>\n<p>To get things started, we need to send ourselves an email so we have a prompt to answer the questions.</p>\n<p>To do that, we need to set up a zap in Zapier.</p>\n<p>From the Zapier home page, click on the menu navigation and select Zaps.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163410582901.png\" alt=\"Zaps\" /></p>\n<p>Click on <strong>Make A New Zap</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163410583402.png\" alt=\"making a new zap\" /></p>\n<p>The Zap we’re setting up is to send daily emails. We&#8217;ll set up another Zap to parse the data into the Google Sheets.</p>\n<p>At the top of the screen, we can name our zap. Let’s name it <strong>Sending daily emails</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163410584103.png\" alt=\"Sending daily emails\" /></p>\n<p>First, we select a trigger. Search for <strong>Schedule by Zapier</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163410584604.png\" alt=\"setting a schedule\" /></p>\n<p>We then need to select the frequency of the trigger. We could make this daily, weekly, or monthly. On this occasion, we&#8217;re selecting daily.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163410585105.png\" alt=\"daily\" /></p>\n<p>Next, we can choose if we want the email to be sent at the weekends and what time of the day we want to receive the email.</p>\n<p>If we&#8217;re setting this up with our work email, it may be worth turning it off for weekends if we don’t work then. It’s best if we set the time for the end of the day, so all the events of the day are over and we have enough time to answer the questions. Setting it an hour before we leave is a good option.<br />\nIt will ask us to test the trigger. Once done, continue.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163410585506.png\" alt=\"setting up the trigger\" /></p>\n<p>The action we want to happen with the above trigger is to send the email with our questions. We can do this by selecting <strong>Email by Zapier</strong>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163410586007.png\" alt=\"action\" /></p>\n<p>Once selected, we want to choose the action type as outbound email.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163410586408.png\" alt=\"outbound\" /></p>\n<p>Next, we enter the email address we want to receive the questions at, the subject line, and the body of the email (which will be our questions). We&#8217;ll also need to enter an email address in the “Reply-To” field, but we&#8217;ll do that later. </p>\n<p>Make sure that you leave space between each question so your answers can get parsed. You want three line breaks worth of space. At this point, we want a copy of the body of the email, so paste it to a Word doc or text note, as we&#8217;ll be using that later. The rest of the fields we can leave blank.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/create-your-own-brag-document-with-zapier-and-google-sheets/?utm_source=rss\">Create Your Own Brag Document with Zapier and Google Sheets</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Websites and web applications are also increasing in complexity. Operations that required a supercomputer some decades ago now runs on a smartphone. One of those things is face detection.</strong></p>\n<p>The ability to detect and analyze a face is super useful, as it enables us to add clever features. Think of automatically blurring faces (like Google Maps does), panning and scaling a webcam feed to focus on people (like Microsoft Teams), validating a passport, adding silly filters (like Instagram and Snapchat), and much more. But before we can do all that, we first need to find the face!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js\">Face-api.js</a> is a library that enables developers to use face detection in their apps without requiring a background in machine learning.</p>\n<p><em>The code for this tutorial is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/demo-face-api-js\">GitHub</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"facedetectionwithmachinelearning\">Face Detection with Machine Learning</h2>\n<p>Detecting objects, like a face, is quite complex. Think about it: perhaps we could write a program that scans pixels to find the eyes, nose, and mouth. It can be done, but to make it totally reliable is practically unachievable, given the many factors to account for. Think of lighting conditions, facial hair, the vast variety of shapes and colors, makeup, angles, face masks, and so much more.</p>\n<p>Neural networks, however, excel at these kinds of problems and can be generalized to account for most (if not all) conditions. We can create, train, and use neural networks in the browser with TensorFlow.js, a popular JavaScript machine learning library. However, even if we use an off-the-shelf, pre-trained model, we&#8217;d still get a little bit into the nitty-gritty of supplying the information to TensorFlow and interpreting the output. If you&#8217;re interested in the technical details of machine learning, check out “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/machine-learning-python-primer/\">A Primer on Machine Learning with Python</a>”.</p>\n<p>Enter face-api.js. It wraps all of this into an intuitive API. We can pass an <code>img</code>, <code>canvas</code>, or <code>video</code> DOM element and the library will return one or a set of results. Face-api.js can detect faces, but also estimate various things in them, as listed below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Face detection</strong>: get the boundaries of one or multiple faces. This is useful for determining where and how big the faces are in a picture.</li>\n<li><strong>Face landmark detection</strong>: get the position and shape of the eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth and lips, and chin. This can be used to determine facing direction or to project graphics on specific regions, like a mustache between the nose and lips.</li>\n<li><strong>Face recognition</strong>: determine who&#8217;s in the picture.</li>\n<li><strong>Face expression detection</strong>: get the expression from a face. Note that the mileage may vary for different cultures.</li>\n<li><strong>Age and gender detection</strong>: get the age and gender from a face. Note that for “gender” classification, it classifies a face as feminine or masculine, which doesn’t necessarily reveal their gender.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before you use any of this beyond experiments, please take note that artificial intelligence excels at amplifying biases. Gender classification works well for cisgendered people, but it can&#8217;t detect the gender of my nonbinary friends. It will identify white people most of the time but frequently fails to detect people of color.</p>\n<p>Be very thoughtful about using this technology and test thoroughly with a diverse testing group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<p>We can install face-api.js via npm:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"shell language-shell\">npm install face-api.js\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, to skip setting up build tools, I&#8217;ll include the UMD bundle via unpkg.org:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">/* globals faceapi */\r\nimport 'https://unpkg.com/face-api.js@0.22.2/dist/face-api.min.js';\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>After that, we&#8217;ll need to download the correct <a href=\"https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights\">pre-trained model(s) from the library’s repository</a>. Determine what we want to know from faces, and use the <a href=\"https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js#models\">Available Models section</a> to determine which models are required. Some features work with multiple models. In that case, we have to choose between bandwidth/performance and accuracy. Compare the file size of the various available models and choose whichever you think is best for your project.</p>\n<p>Unsure which models you need for your use? You can return to this step later. When we use the API without loading the required models, an error will be thrown, stating which model the library expects.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1621972814error-model.jpg\" alt=\"console error message\" /></p>\n<p>We’re now ready to use <a href=\"https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js#high-level-api\">the face-api.js API</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"examples\">Examples</h2>\n<p>Let’s build some stuff!</p>\n<p>For the examples below, I’ll load a random image from <a href=\"https://source.unsplash.com\">Unsplash Source</a> with this function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function loadRandomImage() {\r\n  const image = new Image();\r\n\r\n  image.crossOrigin = true;\r\n\r\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n    image.addEventListener('error', (error) =&gt; reject(error));\r\n    image.addEventListener('load', () =&gt; resolve(image));\r\n    image.src = 'https://source.unsplash.com/512x512/?face,friends';\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/face-api-js-face-detection/?utm_source=rss\">Face Detection on the Web with Face-api.js</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

The Book</h2>\n\n<p>There are over two billion portable touchscreen devices in use today, and hundreds of millions more installed in cars and kiosks. Sales of traditional mouse-and-keyboard computers have been falling for years, replaced by mobile phones and tablets.</p>\n\n<p>Conventional computers now sport touchscreens and otherwise blur the lines between device types – and between mobile and desktop operating systems. Mobile and touch are <strong>the new computing normal</strong>, but there is a lot of myth, rumor, error, bias, and out-of-date information on how portable touchscreens are used.</p>\n\n<p><em>Touch Design for Mobile Interfaces</em> presents and shares real information on hardware, people, interactions, and environments. Steven Hoober has studied <strong>how people really touch and hold</strong> phones and tablets, as well as seeing it firsthand over twenty years designing products for mobile phones, tablets, kiosks, and computers.</p>\n\n<p>As well as Steven’s in-depth research, the book includes tips, tricks, trends, tendencies, guidelines, and heuristics you can apply to your own designs immediately.</p>\n\n<p><em>400 pages.

Notion recently launched its own <abbr title=\"application programming interface\">API</abbr>, and in this article we&#8217;ll use this API to create a small interface that will connect Notion to our own database.</strong></p>\n<p>Notion has released its API to the world in <a href=\"https://developers.notion.com/changelog/hello-world-notion-api-is-now-in-public-beta\">open beta</a>. It has excellent documentation, it&#8217;s really easy to access and, more importantly for us JavaScript devs, it also offers as <a href=\"https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js\">SDK for JavaScript</a>. 🎉</p>\n<p><em>While no previous knowledge is needed to follow along with this article (I&#8217;ll provide all the required steps) we will be dealing with front-end and back-end code, as there&#8217;s a bit of Node.js and Express setup involved.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"setup\">Setup</h2>\n<p>Our setup will be split into two sections. The first will cover the steps that we need to follow on the Notion software and API. In the second, we&#8217;ll get our hands on the code by initializing a folder, adding the Notion dependency and creating the initial <code>index.js</code> and editing the <code>package.json</code> to make everything work.</p>\n<p>To follow along, you&#8217;ll need a Notion account (more on that below), as well as a recent copy of <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Node installed on your machine</a>. As ever, the <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/notion-api\">code for the tutorial can be found on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thenotionsetup\">The Notion Setup</h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t already have a Notion account, please create one by following <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/login\">this link</a>. It has a very generous free tier and you don&#8217;t have to add any payment information!</p>\n<p>After creating your account and logging in, create a new page by choosing <strong>Add a page</strong> and give it a name. For this tutorial, we&#8217;ll choose the <code>Table</code> database. This will give us an empty table, which is exactly what we want!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1625765246notion-empty-table.jpeg\" alt=\"The empty table that we've just created\" /></p>\n<p>The next step is to create some columns on our <code>database</code> and fill them with some mock data. For this tutorial, we&#8217;ll work just with <code>Name</code> and <code>Role</code> fields, as if we&#8217;re working with a database of employees in a company.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1625765286notion-filled-table.jpeg\" alt=\"The table with the new fields and mock data\" /></p>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ll go to the <a href=\"https://developers.notion.com/\">Notion API</a> website. You&#8217;ll see a <strong>My integrations</strong> link in the top corner. If you click it, you&#8217;ll be directed to a screen showing “My integrations”, and yours will be empty, of course.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1625765333notion-api-my-integrations-page.jpeg\" alt=\"Notion API My Integrations page\" /></p>\n<p>Press <strong>Create new integration</strong>, fill in your title and be sure to choose your <code>Associated workspace</code> (it will be chosen by default but make sure of this). Press <strong>Submit</strong> and you&#8217;ll be directed to a new page with an <code>Internal Integration Token</code> (we&#8217;ll use this on our code) and with two option boxes for where you want to use your integration. You don&#8217;t need to do anything on this page other than copying your <code>token</code> and press <strong>Save changes</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: at the time of writing, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/ofcrmc/integration_delete/\">there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a way to delete integrations</a>, so name them wisely.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1625765367notion-api-create-a-new-integration-page.jpeg\" alt=\"Notion API Create a new integration page\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1625765434notion-api-integration-created-with-secret-token.jpeg\" alt=\"Notion API integration page with token\" /></p>\n<p>Now go back to your Notion workspace. On our newly created database, we want to press <strong>Share</strong>, then <strong>Invite</strong>. You&#8217;ll then be able to choose your newly created integration. Choose it and press <strong>Invite</strong>, and your Notion setup is done. Well done! 🙌</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1625765506notion-page-with-modal-to-share-with-integration.jpeg\" alt=\"Notion workspace with modal for integration\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"thecodesetup\">The code setup</h3>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s do some code. Open your terminal and do <code>mkdir notion-api-test</code> (this will create a folder called <code>notion-api-test</code>) on your chosen location, and after that, step into your folder with <code>cd notion-api-test</code> and do <code>npm init -y</code> (this command will create a <code>package.json</code> with some basic setup and the <code>-y</code> flag answers to some prompts automatically so you don&#8217;t have to bother yourself with them).</p>\n<p>As I mentioned before, we&#8217;re going to use <a href=\"https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js\">notion-sdk-js</a>, and for that we need to install it as a dependency, so we&#8217;re going to do <code>npm install @notionhq/client</code>.<br />\nNow, open your <code>notion-api-test</code> on your code editor and create an initial <code>index.js</code> on the <code>root</code> and edit the <code>package.json scripts</code> by replacing what&#8217;s there with the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"scripts\": {\r\n    \"start\": \"node index\"\r\n},\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let&#8217;s also create a <code>.gitignore</code> file and another one called <code>.env</code>. The <code>.gitignore</code> allows you to put different file/folder names inside, and that means that these files/folders won&#8217;t be added to your repo when you push you code. This is very important, because our <code>integration token</code>(remember that?) will be inside the<code>.env</code> file, like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">NOTION_API_KEY = YOUR_TOKEN_HERE\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>That means that inside your <code>.gitignore</code> you should add this on the first line:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">.env\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now that we have an <code>.env</code> file, we should also add a new dependency, <a href=\"https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv\">dotenv</a>, so you can load your <code>NOTION_API_KEY</code> variable. You can do that by doing <code>npm install dotenv</code>.</p>\n<p>The code setup is now done 🎉. <!-- and your folder should look like the following image --></p>\n<h2 id=\"pullingdatafromthenotionapi\">Pulling Data From the Notion API</h2>\n<p>Now that the boring part is over, let&#8217;s get to the good stuff! Our <code>index.js</code> file will be a Node.js file, and the following code block shows our starting code and what each line exactly does!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// this will allow us to import our variable\r\nrequire(\"dotenv\").config();\r\n// the following lines are required to initialize a Notion client\r\nconst { Client } = require(\"@notionhq/client\");\r\n// this line initializes the Notion Client using our key\r\nconst notion = new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_API_KEY });\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We also need an extra thing here, which is the ID of the database that we created on our Notion workspace. This can be obtained from the browser&#8217;s URL bar. It comes after your workspace name (if you have one) and the slash (<code>myworkspace/</code>) and before the question mark (<code>?</code>). The ID is 32 characters long, containing numbers and letters.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">https://www.notion.so/myworkspace/a8aec43384f447ed84390e8e42c2e089?v=...\r\n                                  |--------- Database ID --------|\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>For security purposes, you should also paste this ID into your <code>.env</code> file, so that it looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">NOTION_API_KEY = YOUR_TOKEN_HERE\r\nNOTION_API_DATABASE = YOUR_DATABASE_ID_HERE\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We&#8217;ll then import it into our <code>index.js</code> with this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const databaseId = process.env.NOTION_API_DATABASE;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, to make sure that our API is working, let&#8217;s create a function that makes a call to our database. To do it, we&#8217;ll create an <code>async function</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const getDatabase = async () =&gt; {\r\n  const response = await notion.databases.query({ database_id: databaseId });\r\n\r\n  console.log(response);\r\n};\r\n\r\ngetDatabase();\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you now run <code>npm start</code> in your terminal, you should see a log of an <code>object</code> with a <code>results</code> property that has an array. That array contains the entries in your database. To look into them, we can do the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const getDatabase = async () =&gt; {\r\n  const response = await notion.databases.query({ database_id: databaseId });\r\n\r\n  const responseResults = response.results.map((page) =&gt; {\r\n    return {\r\n      id: page.id,\r\n      name: page.properties.Name.title[0]?.plain_text,\r\n      role: page.properties.Role.rich_text[0]?.plain_text,\r\n    };\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // this console.log is just so you can see what we're getting here\r\n  console.log(responseResults);\r\n  return responseResults;\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code above is mapping through our <code>results</code> (matching the entries in our database) and we&#8217;re mapping the paths for different properties to names that we&#8217;re choosing (in this case, <code>id</code>, <code>name</code> and <code>role</code>). Notice how specific the object path is. I&#8217;ve used <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining\">optional chaining</a> to account for blank rows in the database, or rows where one or the other of these fields isn&#8217;t filled out.</p>\n<p>Either way, feel free to play with the different properties, and be aware that this is a matter of trial and error, and that every API behaves and organizes the information differently. The important thing here is to go through each property until we get to the info we&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n<p>If looking into each property and using <code>console.log()</code> is not your thing, you could always use Postman to inspect the response. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not within the scope of this tutorial, but you could check the “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/master-api-workflow-postman/\">How to Master Your API Workflow with Postman</a>” post to give it a go!</p>\n<p>Another important note here: notice the <code>notion.databases.query</code> that we&#8217;ve used. If you look at the <a href=\"https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-database-query\">Notion API documentation</a>, you&#8217;ll see that we&#8217;re using <code>POST | Query a database</code>. We could use just <code>GET | Retrieve a database</code>, but here I would like to challenge you to read the documentation and try to sort the list differently!</p>\n<p>Before we wrap this part, let&#8217;s change our <code>getDatabase</code> function so we can properly import it into another file that we&#8217;ll create. It should look like the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">exports.getDatabase = async function () {\r\n  const response = await notion.databases.query({ database_id: databaseId });\r\n\r\n  const responseResults = response.results.map((page) =&gt; {\r\n    return {\r\n      id: page.id,\r\n      name: page.properties.Name.title[0]?.plain_text,\r\n      role: page.properties.Role.rich_text[0]?.plain_text,\r\n    };\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return responseResults;\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"settingupanexpressserver\">Setting up an Express Server</h2>\n<p>With the previous step done, we now can successfully retrieve our results. But to be able to actually use them properly, we&#8217;ll need to create a server, and the easiest way of doing so — since we&#8217;re using Node.js — is to use <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express</a>. So, we&#8217;ll get started by running <code>npm install express</code> and creating a new file at the root called <code>server.js</code>.</p>\n<p>If <code>express</code> confuses you, don&#8217;t worry. We&#8217;ll be using it to facilitate our work and create a quick back end and server to our application. Without it, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to properly retrieve our data, since we&#8217;re initializing our Notion client within our code.</p>\n<p>On our <code>server.js</code> file, we&#8217;ll start by importing <code>express</code>, the module where we have our code (<code>index.js</code>), our <code>getDatabase</code> function, a port number, and a variable to initialize our <code>express</code> function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const express = require(\"express\");\r\n// our module\r\nconst moduleToFetch = require(\"./index\");\r\n// our function\r\nconst getDatabase = moduleToFetch.getDatabase;\r\n\r\nconst port = 8000;\r\nconst app = express();\r\n\r\n// this last command will log a message on your terminal when you do `npm start`\r\napp.listen(port, console.log(`Server started on ${port}`));\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since we&#8217;re now importing our code into a new file, <code>server.js</code>, we should change our <code>start</code> command on <code>package.json</code> to look for <code>server</code>, so it should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"scripts\": {\r\n    \"start\": \"node server\"\r\n},\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you now run <code>npm start</code>, you&#8217;ll see the <code>Server started on 8000</code> message, which means that our setup is working as expected! Well done!</p>\n<p>Now that our <code>express</code> app is working, we need to get our database to work with it, and we can do that with <code>app.get()</code>. This method needs a path (it won&#8217;t matter in our case) and a callback function (which will invoke our <code>getDatabase</code> function):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">app.get(\"/users\", async (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n  const users = await getDatabase();\r\n  res.json(users);\r\n});\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above code uses the <code>app.get</code> method, as referred, and inside our callback function we&#8217;re getting the results from our function and we&#8217;re using the <code>.json()</code> Express middleware function that parses the request into readable and workable data. (You can learn a bit more about it in the <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.json\">official documentation</a>.)</p>\n<p>This means that we&#8217;re now successfully accessing our data, and that we&#8217;ve created a route to “fetch” it. As a final step, we should add <code>app.use(express.static(\"public\"));</code> to our <code>server.js</code> file, so that the end result looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const express = require(\"express\");\r\n// our module\r\nconst moduleToFetch = require(\"./index\");\r\n// our function\r\nconst getDatabase = moduleToFetch.getDatabase;\r\n\r\nconst port = 8000;\r\nconst app = express();\r\n\r\n// the code line we just added\r\napp.use(express.static(\"public\"));\r\n\r\napp.get(\"/users\", async (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n  const users = await getDatabase();\r\n  res.json(users);\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.listen(port, console.log(`Server started on ${port}`));\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This last bit of code tells our back end to <code>use</code> a specific folder where we&#8217;ll create our front-end code, which will be the <code>public</code> folder. Here we&#8217;ll work with our HTML, CSS and JavaScript to access this <code>/users</code> route that we created on our back end. Let&#8217;s get to it!</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/notion-api-javascript-sdk/?utm_source=rss\">Getting Started with the Notion API and Its JavaScript SDK</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

This helps you determine if there&#8217;s market fit for your application before wasting time and money on a product nobody&#8217;s interested in. This is known as a “minimum viable product” (MVP). In this tutorial, you&#8217;ll learn how to build an MVP using React and Firebase, a backend-as-a-service platform.</strong></p>\n<p>In order to provide the most value, we won&#8217;t be developing the React + Firebase application step by step. Instead, I&#8217;ll break down a working prototype and explain the key concepts using pseudo-like coding language. The actual code is quite verbose, as it&#8217;s mostly front-end logic designed to deal with many aspects such as state management, responsive UI design and accessibility.</p>\n<p>My goal is to show you the architectural design of building web interfaces that are linked to a serverless back end. The complete Firebase project we&#8217;ll use is located in our GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/sitepoint-books-firebase\">repository</a>. At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to apply these concepts in your own MVP web projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyfirebase\">Why Firebase?</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to build a web application on a serverless platform, you&#8217;ll come across a myriad of providers that offer all the essential services you need to build your product. These services include authentication, database, cloud functions, storage, analytics and many more.</p>\n<p>If you were to pick the best of class for each service, you&#8217;d have a pretty high learning curve figuring out how to make all these services work together in your application. You also expose your product to a number of security risks as there are multiple end-points that your product connects to in order to work. There are measures to protect your application, but most developers are unaware of what security issues need to be plugged.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> is a back-end-as-a-service platform that conveniently provides a number of essential services under one roof. This reduces the learning curve and also makes it easier to build secure web and mobile applications.</p>\n<p>These Firebase services include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>authentication</li>\n<li>database</li>\n<li>storage</li>\n<li>cloud functions</li>\n<li>analytics</li>\n<li>hosting</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Take note that this tutorial is written for intermediate to advanced React developers who want to quickly learn how to use Firebase for their projects. I&#8217;ve provided a few additional topics that you need to be familiar with before proceeding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-tailwind-css-build-site/\">React and TailwindCSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-query-fetch-manage-data/\">React Query</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/vitejs-front-end-build-tool-introduction/\">Vite</a> — a better alternative to <code>create-react-app</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"firebaseprojectplan\">Firebase Project Plan</h2>\n<p>The project we&#8217;ll be looking at is a simple online library that organizes data into books, authors and categories. Below is an entity relationship diagram.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/162929495001-entity-relationship-diagram.png\" alt=\"entity relationship diagram\" /></p>\n<p>The application logic has been organized into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>screen containers (pages or views)</li>\n<li>presentational components (forms, tables)</li>\n<li>layout components (footer, navbar)</li>\n<li>shareable UI components (alerts, modals, page headers)</li>\n<li>Firebase services (database, storage)</li>\n<li>Firebase config scripts (back-end connectors)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is an illustration of the main project&#8217;s architecture:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/162929495302-application-architecture-diagram.png\" alt=\"application architecture diagram\" /></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be using the following folder structure to organize our code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">├── components\r\n│   ├── entity (e.g. book)\r\n│   │   ├── Card.jsx (-&gt; BookCard)\r\n│   │   ├── Detail.jsx (-&gt; BookDetail)\r\n│   │   ├── Form.jsx\r\n│   │   └── List.jsx\r\n│   └── ui\r\n│       └── Component.jsx (e.g. PageHeader, Alert)\r\n├── layout\r\n│   ├── Footer.jsx\r\n│   └── Navbar.jsx\r\n├── screens\r\n│   ├── entity\r\n│   │   ├── Detail.jsx (-&gt; ScreenBookDetail)\r\n│   │   ├── Form.jsx (-&gt; ScreenBookForm)\r\n│   │   └── List.jsx\r\n│   ├── category\r\n│   │   ├── Form.jsx\r\n│   │   └── List.jsx\r\n│   ├── Home.jsx\r\n│   └── NotFound.jsx\r\n└── services\r\n    └── Service.js (e.g. Database, Storage)\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>-&gt;</code> symbol denotes an example of how a functional component is named. Check out this <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/structuring-projects-and-naming-components-in-react-1261b6e18d76\">guide</a> for more information on naming conventions for front-end applications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firebaseprojectsetup\">Firebase Project Setup</h2>\n<p>The project we&#8217;ll use was scaffolded using a Vite + React template. To set up the project in your workspace, simply open a terminal and execute the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># Clone project\r\ngit clone git@github.com:sitepoint-editors/sitepoint-books-firebase.git\r\ncd sitepoint-books-firebase\r\n\r\n# Install dependencies\r\nnpm install\r\n\r\n# Prepare environment config file\r\ncp env.example .env.local\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Don&#8217;t launch the dev server just yet, as we need to set up our Firebase back end first, which we&#8217;ll do in the next step.</p>\n<h2 id=\"firebasesetup\">Firebase Setup</h2>\n<p>Head over to <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> and sign in with your Google account. Then:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create a new Firebase project and call it <code>SitePointBooks</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don&#8217;t enable Google Analytics for this project. Hit the <strong>Create project</strong> button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Firebase console, create a new <strong>Web App</strong> and call it <code>sitepoint-books-app</code>. You can access the Firebase console as demonstrated in the screenshot below.<br />\n<img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630935311firebase-mvp-create-project.png\" alt=\"firebase-mvp-create-project\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the next step, give your app a name (this can be the same as the project name) and then click <strong>Register app</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the <strong>Add Firebase SDK</strong> section, select <strong>Use npm</strong> and copy the output.<br />\n<img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/163093530703-firebase-web-app-config.png\" alt=\"03-firebase-web-app-config\" /><br />\nThere are a wide number of Firebase SDKs available. You can find out more about these <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/client/libraries\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, make a note of your Firebase config and click <strong>Continue to console</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do note that Firebase API keys are safe to expose to the public, as access to back-end resources is guarded via Firebase security rules. That is, they can only be accessed by an authenticated user. Unfortunately for this tutorial, we&#8217;ll need to disable them, since we won&#8217;t deal with Firebase authentication.</p>\n<p>For a quick setup, you can simply copy the provided script into a <code>firebase.js</code> file. However, I prefer saving the Firebase configuration settings using an <code>.env.local</code> file. Here&#8217;s a Firebase configuration example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"yaml language-yaml\">VITE_API_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDfoP234E8waxeN8QZVrkA5LXqjjyPeFYs\r\nVITE_API_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=sitepointdemo-26ea0.firebaseapp.com\r\nVITE_API_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=sitepointdemo-26ea0\r\nVITE_API_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=sitepointdemo-26ea0.appspot.com\r\nVITE_API_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=292100755259\r\nVITE_API_FIREBASE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:292100755259:web:38be20c9ab080b4ab1b11e\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t use these Firebase configuration settings, as they were created for a temporary project.</em></p>\n<p>Do note that this only prevents storing of Firebase config keys in your repository. Once you build and deploy your application, it&#8217;s quite easy for a malicious attacker to gain access to these keys via the browser inspection tools. This demonstrates the importance of setting up authentication.</p>\n<p>Currently, our Firebase back end is empty. In the next steps, we&#8217;ll populate it with data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cloudstorage\">Cloud storage</h3>\n<p>Firebase&#8217;s Cloud Storage is a service that allows developers to store images, video, audio and other user-generated content. For this tutorial, we&#8217;ll only use it to store images. Head over to the Storage page and click the <strong>Get Started</strong> button. A popup wizard will appear. Simply accept the default rules and choose a location for your default bucket. After clicking done, a storage bucket will be created for you in a short while.</p>\n<p>On the next page, perform the following actions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create the following folders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>categories</code></li>\n<li><code>books</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upload the images I&#8217;ve provided via this <a href=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1629975705sitepoint-book-images.zip\">zip file</a>. You should have the following structure:<br />\n<img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/162929495904-firebase-cloud-storage.png\" alt=\"04-firebase-cloud-storage\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the <strong>Rules</strong> tab and update the security rules to allow our unauthenticated app to access these files. Do note the following settings will expose your storage back end to the public:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">rules_version = '2';\r\nservice firebase.storage {\r\n  match /b/{bucket}/o {\r\n    match /{allPaths=**} {\r\n      allow read, write: if true;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Firebase uses a custom language based on <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cel-spec\">Common Expression Language</a> to define its security rules. Due to the learning curve involved, we won&#8217;t be able to discuss it in this article. Check out the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/rules-language?hl=el\">official docs</a> on this topic.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve completed populating your Cloud Storage with the provided images, you can proceed with the next step.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cloudfirestore\">Cloud Firestore</h3>\n<p>For the database, we&#8217;ll use <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore\">Cloud Firestore</a>, which is a scalable NoSQL database that allows developers to structure data using collections. The older <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/database\">Firebase Realtime Database</a> is also a NoSQL database, but it stores all your data in a flat nested JSON structure that&#8217;s difficult to query.</p>\n<p>In your console, head over to the Firestore Database page and click the <strong>Create Database</strong> button. A popup wizard should appear:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the first page, set <strong>Start in test mode</strong> to allow insecure access to the database for the next 30 days.</li>\n<li>On the next page, set the database region then click <strong>Enable</strong> button.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the database is initialized, we can proceed with populating the database. Before you start populating, you should be aware that the Firestore database UI doesn&#8217;t support automatic linking and validation when linking two collections. So you&#8217;ll need to open a second browser tab and copy an ID from one record to a reference field, as shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1630938518firestore-place-id.png\" alt=\"firestore-place-id\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also need to make sure there&#8217;s no white space around the ID value when you paste it in a reference field. Otherwise, a null object will be returned when you perform a query. With that out of the way, you can begin creating and populating your Firestore database as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>authors</code>collection, all field types are string:</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Darren Jones</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mike Aboagye</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li><code>categories</code> collection, all field types are string:</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Cover</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>javascript</td>\n<td>categories/javascript.png</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>python</td>\n<td>categories/python.png</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>react</td>\n<td>categories/react.png</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li><code>books</code>collection, all field types are string except <code>author_id</code> and <code>category_id</code>. You&#8217;ll have to manually copy the relevant unique ids(<code>place_id</code>) into the reference fields as demonstrated in the screenshot above:</li>\n</ul>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Title</th>\n<th>Learn to Code with JavaScript</th>\n<th>Data Science: Tools &amp; Skills</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cover</strong></td>\n<td>books/learn-to-code-with-javascript.jpg</td>\n<td>books/data science &#8211; tools &amp; skills.png</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>author_id (reference)</strong></td>\n<td>/authors/{place id}</td>\n<td>/authors/{place id}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>category_id (reference)</strong></td>\n<td>/categories/{place id}</td>\n<td>/categories/{place id}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Description</strong></td>\n<td>This easy-to-follow and fun guide is the perfect place to start on your coding journey.

Do note that it&#8217;s a prototype application built for learning and not all features are fully implemented.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/162929496506-app-book-detail.png\" alt=\"app book detail\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"firebaseprojectlogic\">Firebase Project Logic</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s now start breaking down the project so that you can learn how the front-end interfaces are built to connect and interact with the Firebase back end. The focus will mainly be on state management logic for this tutorial. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the user interface code used in this Firebase project, please refer to the following documentations for the UI libraries used in the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">TailwindCSS</a> and <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins\">plugins</a>: primary CSS framework</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://headlessui.dev/\">HeadlessUI</a>: small collection of unstyled UI components</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heroicons.com/\">HeroIcons</a>: collection of handcrafted SVG icons by Tailwind CSS team</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daisyui.com/\">DaisyUI</a>: TailwindCSS component library</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://react-hook-form.com/react\">React Hook Form</a>: form state library</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jquense/yup\">Yup</a>: form validation library</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"routing\">Routing</h3>\n<p>Building a CRUD interface for a project that involves more than two entities can quickly get complicated. For routing, I used <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-router-complete-guide/\">React Router</a> and implemented a routing structure using a standardized syntax. That is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>list route: <code>/{entity}</code></li>\n<li>create route: <code>/{entity}/create</code></li>\n<li>edit route: <code>/{entity}/edit/:id</code></li>\n<li>detail route: <code>/{entity}/:id</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a simplified view of how routing has been implemented in <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/sitepoint-books-firebase/blob/master/src/App.jsx\"><code>App.jsx</code></a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\n// Layout components\r\nimport Footer from \"@/layout/Footer\";\r\nimport Navbar from \"@/layout/Navbar\";\r\n\r\n// Screen(pages or views) containers\r\nimport Home from \"@/screens/Home\";\r\nimport NotFound from \"@/screens/NotFound\";\r\nimport ScreenBookList from \"@/screens/book/List\";\r\nimport ScreenBookForm from \"@/screens/book/Form\";\r\nimport ScreenBookDetail from \"@/screens/book/Detail\";\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;header&gt;\r\n        &lt;Navbar /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/header&gt;\r\n      &lt;main&gt;\r\n        &lt;Switch&gt;\r\n          &lt;Route exact path=\"/\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;Home /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Route&gt;\r\n          &lt;Route exact path=\"/book\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;ScreenBookList /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Route&gt;\r\n          &lt;Route path=\"/book/edit/:id\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;ScreenBookForm /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Route&gt;\r\n          &lt;Route path=\"/book/detail/:id\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;ScreenBookDetail /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Route&gt;\r\n          &lt;Route path=\"/book/create\"&gt;\r\n            &lt;ScreenBookForm /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Route&gt;\r\n          &lt;Route component={NotFound} /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/Switch&gt;\r\n      &lt;/main&gt;\r\n      &lt;Footer /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Take note that <code>ScreenBookForm</code> has been re-used for both create and edit routes. You&#8217;ll later see how a single form container can be used to handle both use cases. Next, we&#8217;ll look at how the React app connects to the Firebase back end.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-firebase-build-mvp/?utm_source=rss\">How to Build an MVP with React and Firebase</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll be cloning the Hacker News <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">home page</a>, making use of React and HarperDB.</strong></p>\n<p>By the time we&#8217;re done, our cloned version of the Hacker News home page should look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631796896hackernewsclone.png\" alt=\"Our cloned version\" /></p>\n<p>The code for this project can be found in its <a href=\"https://github.com/KingsleyUbah/hacker-news-clone\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofcloning\">The Benefits of Cloning</h2>\n<p>Building a clone of a web page has the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It helps you to give attention to design intricacies and nuances. This makes you a more comprehensive designer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It helps you get familiar with color and typography. These are very important concepts that every front-end developer/designer should be proficient with.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It allows you learn about new technologies. You get to use new tech stacks and broaden the scope of your knowledge and skills.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"aboutthereactuseharperdbtechstack\">About the React/useHarperDB Tech Stack</h2>\n<p>The stack we&#8217;ll be using for this project is primarily is the React/useHarperDB stack.</p>\n<p>HarperDB is a data management software. It&#8217;s great for cases where you need NoSQL and SQL capabilities, rapid application development, integration, edge computing, distributed computing, and real-time operational analytics.</p>\n<p>HarperDB is also flexible. It allows you do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>make queries to a single endpoint</li>\n<li>use both SQL and NoSQL to query your database</li>\n<li>upload data in JSON and with SQL queries</li>\n<li>upload bulk data in a single CSV file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s very fast, simple to use and allows you to set up in a serverless way. The serverless architecture entails the abstraction of the back-end tasks to another service.</p>\n<p>In simpler terms, as the developer you don&#8217;t have to implement a back end and a database for the web application on your local machine. Instead, a platform like HarperDB takes care of the back-end operations and provides you with a way to access and manage data from its infrastructure, through the cloud. That way, you can focus on front-end development.</p>\n<p>Throughout the development process, we&#8217;ll be using the following tools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"react\">React</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be using the React library for our home page clone. React is a front-end JavaScript library for building reusable user interface components. For example, say you want to use a similar button in two or more places on your website. With HTML, you&#8217;d define the markup for that button in every section you want to use it. This isn&#8217;t consistent with the DRY (don&#8217;t repeat yourself) principle. With React, all you need to do is define a single button component and then register that component in every section you intend to use it within the app. This simplifies the entire building process and cleans up your code. </p>\n<p>Instead of manually installing React and setting up the tedious configurations, we&#8217;ll use the <code>create-react-app</code> tool to instantly build out a working framework for us. This will help save time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nodeandnpm\">Node and npm</h3>\n<p>The React, React DOM and thousands of other packages all live inside of the npm registry. To be able to install these dependencies on our local machine, we&#8217;ll need to have Node and npm installed. You can install Node from <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure if Node is already installed on your computer, or you&#8217;re unsure of which version is currently installed, simply open a command terminal on your machine and type in <code>node -v</code>. If you have Node installed, it should display the version of Node you have installed. Note that you should have a node version of at least 12.xx to run this project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aharperdbcloudaccount\">A HarperDB Cloud account</h3>\n<p>To set up a database, we&#8217;ll need to create an instance for our app. To create an instance, we&#8217;ll first need to sign up to Harper. After setting up our database cloud instance, we&#8217;ll need to use the username, password and database URL later in our React app. In the database, we&#8217;ll create a table that holds the list of Hacker News posts that will be displayed later on the web page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"useharperdb\">useHarperDB</h3>\n<p>This is a React hook provided by Harper. This hook essentially acts as a bridge between our React App and the database. By calling this function inside our React component and passing in some important parameters — including an SQL query — we&#8217;ll be able to access the posts from our cloud database. This package will be installed using the Node package manager and details on it can be <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-harperdb?ref=hackernoon.com\">found here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sql\">SQL</h3>\n<p>In this project, we&#8217;ll only be using a single basic SQL query, so having broad knowledge isn&#8217;t required.</p>\n<h3 id=\"css\">CSS</h3>\n<p>Finally, we&#8217;ll be styling our clone using pure CSS with no libraries. Every style we apply will be geared towards mimicking the Harper News home page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hackernewslogo\">Hacker News logo</h3>\n<p>Since we&#8217;re going to be creating an exact replica of the real Hacker News home page, we&#8217;ll need the logo image. You can download the logo in SVG format <a href=\"https://iconscout.com/icon/hacker-news-3521477\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingaharperdbcloudinstance\">Creating a HarperDB Cloud Instance</h2>\n<p>First, we need to set up our cloud instance. We go over to the HarperDB home page and <a href=\"https://studio.harperdb.io/sign-up\">sign up</a> for a free account.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631798005signup.png\" alt=\"Sign up\" /></p>\n<p>After signing up, we&#8217;ll create a HarperDB Cloud instance for our app. Follow the instructions, fill in your username, a password for your instance and your instance name. After doing so, a URL will be generated for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632826326newaddschema.png\" alt=\"Adding your instance info\" /></p>\n<p>In the following page, we&#8217;ll be told to select our specs. Since this is a tutorial, we&#8217;ll go for the free plans.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631800537Hackernewsharperfree.png\" alt=\"Select the specs\" /></p>\n<p>Click on “Confirm Instance Details” and you&#8217;ll be moved to a page which contains all your instance’s information. Now, copy your instance URL, your username, and your password and save it somewhere, as you&#8217;ll need them later.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632826349newconfirminstance.png\" alt=\"Please preserve your username, password and url\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, we confirm the instance. You&#8217;ll immediately see the &#8220;creating instance&#8221; label on the card. This indicates that HarperDB is working on our instance and that it will be all set in a few minutes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632826356newcreatinginstance.png\" alt=\"Spinning up the database\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important that we store our instance credentials in an accessible place, since we&#8217;ll be requiring it later in the tutorial. The credentials are your username, password and instance URL.</p>\n<h2 id=\"settingupourprojectdirectory\">Setting Up Our Project Directory</h2>\n<p>Our database is now spinning up on the side. Now it&#8217;s time to create the directory for our app and install dependencies.</p>\n<p>First, we go over to the terminal and run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx create-react-app hacker-news-clone\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will create a folder named <code>hacker-news-clone</code> and install the React library into the project. Since <code>create-react-app</code> is a code generator, all configurations will be done for us automatically. That way, we can focus more on building our app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingthedatabaseandsupplyingitwithdata\">Creating the Database and Supplying it with Data</h2>\n<p>Going back to HarperDB, we&#8217;ll need to provide it with the data for our page. This data will be a list of Hacker news posts which we&#8217;ll display on our front end.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creatingaschemaandatablewithinthedatabase\">Creating a schema and a table within the database</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll need to define a schema for our database. A schema is the structural form of a database. It defines how data is going to be organized inside the database. In HarperDB, you can simply think of the schema as a collection of tables. We can define multiple tables inside a schema and access those tables from different places within our app.</p>\n<p>From your HarperDB dashboard, click on the card. You&#8217;ll be directed to a new page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632390585nowset.png\" alt=\"Instance is now set. Click on the card to create a schema\" /></p>\n<p>To create a schema, simple click on the <strong>+</strong> icon beside it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632390730addschema.png\" alt=\"How you can add a schema and a table\" /></p>\n<p>For our tutorial, we&#8217;ll be naming our schema &#8220;HackerNews&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Inside the schema, we&#8217;ll define our first table, named <code>posts</code>. This table will hold all of the posts data that will be showing on our page. In addition to the table&#8217;s name, we&#8217;ll also have to pass in a hash attribute for our table. A <strong>hash attribute</strong> is a unique value that distinguishes one row (post) from another row of data inside the table.</p>\n<p>For our posts table, we&#8217;ll set the hash attribute to <code>id</code>. This means the <code>id</code> column will hold unique data for every row in the table.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631801923desktop-posts.png\" alt=\"Schema and table for our posts\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"populatingourtablewithdata\">Populating our table with data</h3>\n<p>At this point, the table is empty. We&#8217;ll have to populate the table with data. HarperDB provides us with various ways of doing this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>by making SQL or NoSQL queries to create data on our database</li>\n<li>by defining a single JSON object (for only one record) and an array of JSON data (for multiple records)</li>\n<li>by importing and loading data with a CSV file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll be supplying data via JSON. Since we&#8217;re inserting multiple records of posts, we&#8217;ll be using an array of JSON object, with each object holding information of a single post.</p>\n<p>Click the little <strong>+</strong> icon on the top right corner and paste in the following JSON data:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">[\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": 1,\r\n    \"title\": \"Intel Is Reducing Server Chip Pricing in Attempt to Stem the AMD Tide\",\r\n    \"website\": \"(tomshardware.com)\",\r\n    \"url\": \"https://www.tomshardware.com\",\r\n    \"points\": 115,\r\n    \"user\": \"rbanffy\",\r\n    \"time\": \"2 hours ago\",\r\n    \"comments\": 67\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": 2,\r\n    \"title\": \"AI recognizes race in medical images\",\r\n    \"website\": \"(explainthispaper.com)\",\r\n    \"url\": \"https://www.explainthispaper.com\",\r\n    \"points\": 31,\r\n    \"user\": \"stuartbman\",\r\n    \"time\": \"30 minutes ago\",\r\n    \"comments\": 15\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: this data is just for two Hacker News posts. You can get data for 30 posts from the <a href=\"https://github.com/KingsleyUbah/hacker-news-clone/blob/main/data/posts.json\">GitHub repository</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Go and click on the green button to insert them into the table. This should dynamically populate our table with the two posts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631800617Hackernewsharperadd.png\" alt=\"Inserting posts using JSON\" /></p>\n<p>With that, we&#8217;ve finished our work on the HarperDB cloud. It&#8217;s now time to focus on the front-end part of our website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"integratingharperdbandourappwithharperdbprovider\">Integrating HarperDB and Our App with HarperDBProvider</h2>\n<p>Right now, our front end is isolated from our back end. We have to connect our HarperDB cloud instance to our React app. Thankfully, HarperDB provides us with a hook for that: <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-harperdb\">use-harperdb</a>.</p>\n<p>We need to install <code>useharperdb</code> into our project. To do so, we run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install use-harperdb\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>For security reasons, we&#8217;ll need to store our instance credentials inside an environmental variable. We&#8217;ll create a file named <code>.env</code> inside the root app (<code>hacker-news-clone</code>) and pass in the following variables:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">REACT_APP_DB_URL=**\r\nREACT_APP_USER=**\r\nREACT_APP_PASSWORD=**\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Please make sure to follow the same format and replace the double asterisks with your own instance information. Pass in your database&#8217;s URL, your username and your password.</p>\n<p>After that, we&#8217;ll go inside the <code>index.js</code> file by navigating to <code>hacker-news-clone/src/index.js</code>. Then we import <code>HarperDBProvider</code> and wrap our entire app inside it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport './index.css';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\nimport { HarperDBProvider } from 'use-harperdb';\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;\r\n    &lt;HarperDBProvider\r\n    url={process.env.REACT_APP_DB_URL}\r\n    user={process.env.REACT_APP_USER}\r\n    password={process.env.REACT_APP_PASSWORD}\r\n    &gt;\r\n      &lt;App /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/HarperDBProvider&gt;\r\n  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n);\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inside the <code>&lt;HarperDBProvider&gt;</code> we pass in our environmental variables. This is a very important step to take, because it essentially makes sure our entire app has the context of our cloud instance and can, therefore, pull data from it.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-harperdb-build-hacker-news-clone/?utm_source=rss\">Build a Hacker News Clone using React and HarperDB</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

But what separates the average from the great programmers is that they know how to <em>undo</em> their mistakes!</strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using Git as your version control system, you already have a host of &#8220;undo tools&#8221; at hand. This post will show you five powerful ways to <strong>undo mistakes with Git</strong>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"discardingsomeofyourlocalchanges\">Discarding Some of Your Local Changes</h2>\n<p>Coding is often a messy process. At times, it feels like you&#8217;re taking two steps forward and one step back. In other words: some of the code that you&#8217;ve produced is great … but some of it not so much. Here&#8217;s where Git can help you: it allows you to keep what&#8217;s good and discard the changes that you don&#8217;t want anymore.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at an example scenario with some &#8220;local&#8221; changes (aka changes we haven&#8217;t committed, yet).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1628079253discard-changes_starting-situation@2x.png\" alt=\"Local, uncommitted changes — some of which we want to discard\" /></p>\n<p><em>Note: for a better overview and clearer visualization, I&#8217;m using the <a href=\"https://www.git-tower.com/?utm_source=sitepoint&#038;utm_medium=guestpost&#038;utm_campaign=undoing-mistakes-in-git\">Tower Git desktop client</a> in some of my screenshots. You don&#8217;t need Tower to follow along with this tutorial.</em></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s tackle the problem in <code>general.css</code> first. The changes we made went in a totally wrong direction. Let&#8217;s undo all of them and recreate the last committed state of that file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ git restore css/general.css\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that, alternatively, I could have used the <code>git checkout</code> command to achieve the same outcome. But because <code>git checkout</code> has so many different jobs and meanings, I strongly prefer the slightly newer <code>git restore</code> command (which is focused solely on these types of tasks).</p>\n<p>Our second problem in <code>index.html</code> is a little bit more tricky. Some of the changes we made in this file are actually great, while only some of them need to be undone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1628079341discard-changes_index-file@2x.png\" alt=\"Undoing only some of the changes in a file, while keeping others intact\" /></p>\n<p>Again, <code>git restore</code> comes to the rescue — but this time with the <code>-p</code> flag, because we want to go down to the &#8220;patch&#8221; level:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ git restore -p index.html\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Git will then take you by the hand and ask you — <em>for every chunk of changes</em> in that file — if you want to discard it or not.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1628079242discard-changes_restore-p.gif\" alt=\"Git asks us what to do with each chunk of changes\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I typed &#8220;n&#8221; for the first chunk (in order to keep it) and &#8220;y&#8221; for the second chunk (in order to discard it). After the process is finished, you can see that only the first, valuable chunk of changes survived — just like we wanted!</p>\n<h2 id=\"resettingaspecificfiletoapreviousstate\">Resetting a Specific File to a Previous State</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you&#8217;ll want to restore a <em>specific</em> file to <em>specific</em> revision. For example, you know that <code>index.html</code> was working fine at some earlier point in time, but now it&#8217;s not. That&#8217;s when you want to turn back time, but only for this specific file and not for the whole project!</p>\n<p>The first thing we have to find out is which exact revision we want to restore.

We&#8217;ll do that by restoring the file at the revision <em>before</em> the bad one!

There are different kinds of loops in JavaScript, and one of them is the for&#8230;in loop.</strong></p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll learn about the <code>for...in</code> loop JavaScript provides. We&#8217;ll look at how the <code>for...in</code> loop is used in JavaScript, its syntax, examples of how it works, when to use it, when not to use it, and what other types of loops we can use instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyuseloops\">Why Use Loops</h2>\n<p>In JavaScript, just as in other programming languages, we use loops to read or access the items of a collection. The collection can be an array or an object. Every pass through the items of a collection is called an <strong>iteration</strong>.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to access an item in a collection. The first way is via its key in the collection, which is an index in an array or a property in an object. The second way is via the item itself, without needing the key.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634532628for-in-loops.jpg\" alt=\"A loop iterates property values and array values\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"definitionoftheforinloop\">Definition of the for…in Loop</h2>\n<p>The JavaScript <code>for...in</code> loop goes through or iterates keys of a collection. Using these keys, you can then access the item it represents in the collection.</p>\n<p>The collection of items can be either arrays, objects, or even strings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"syntaxoftheforinloop\">Syntax of the for…in Loop</h2>\n<p>The <code>for...in</code> loop has the following syntax or structure:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">for (let key in value) {\r\n  //do something here\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this code block, <code>value</code> is the collection of items we&#8217;re iterating over. It can be an object, array, string, and so on. <code>key</code> will be the key of each item in <code>value</code>, changing on each iteration to the next key in the list.</p>\n<p>Note that we use <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> to declare <code>key</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634538136for-in-loop-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"For in loop iterating object properties\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"usingtheforinloopwithobjects\">Using the for…in Loop with Objects</h2>\n<p>When using <code>for...in</code> loop to iterate an object in JavaScript, the iterated keys or properties — which, in the snippet above, are represented by the <code>key</code> variable — are the object&#8217;s own properties.</p>\n<p>As objects might inherit items through the prototype chain, which includes the default methods and properties of Objects as well as Object prototypes we might define, we should then use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty\">hasOwnProperty</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aforinloopobjectexample\">A for…in loop object example</h3>\n<p>In the following example, we&#8217;re looping over the following variable <code>obj</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const obj = {\r\n  1: \"JavaScript\",\r\n  3: \"PHP\",\r\n  2: \"Python\",\r\n  4: \"Java\"\r\n};\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the loop, we&#8217;re rendering the property and value in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element.</p>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"ZEJWOML\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n<span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/ZEJWOML\"><br />\nLooping Objects</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br />\non <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p><script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script></p>\n<p>Notice that the order of the iteration is ascending for the keys (that is, starting with digits in numerical order and then letters in alphabetical order). However, this outputted order is different from the index order of the items as created when initializing the object.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usingaforinloopwitharrays\">Using a for…in Loop with Arrays</h2>\n<p>When using the <code>for...in</code> loop to iterate arrays in JavaScript, <code>key</code> in this case will be the indices of the elements. However, the indices might be iterated in a random order.</p>\n<p>So, if the <code>value</code> variable in the <code>for...in</code> loop syntax structure we showed above was an array of five items, <code>key</code> would not be guaranteed to be 0 to 4. Some indices might precede others. Details on when this might happen is explained later in this article.</p>\n<h3 id=\"forinlooparrayexample\">For…in loop array example</h3>\n<p>In the example below, we&#8217;re looping over the following variable <code>arr</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const arr = [\"Javascript\", \"PHP\", \"Python\", \"Java\"];\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>And in the loop, we&#8217;re rendering the index and the value of each array element.</p>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-slug-hash=\"RwZaRBq\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n<span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/RwZaRBq\"><br />\nLooping Arrays</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br />\non <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p><script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-for-in-loop-basics/?utm_source=rss\">Back to Basics: Understanding the for…in Loop in JavaScript</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Many web publishing tools (such as blogging software and CMSs) convert your content (text, images and so on) into HTML for you. But there are many situations where you want to write HTML content yourself … and marking up content with HTML tags manually is laborious and not really viable. Enter Markdown.</strong></p>\n<p>Markdown is an easy, frictionless way of writing content for the Web and the perfect way for developers to create documentation. It lets you structure and format documents easily using simple, text-based markup, which then gets converted into HTML for you — all from within your favorite text editor.</p>\n<p>If you’re not already using Markdown, now might be the time to begin. You can learn the basics in minutes, and with ongoing use, the syntax will become second nature. In this article, we’ll encourage you to start simply and show you how to use Markdown for a range of common tasks when creating content.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive in!</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatismarkdown\">What Is Markdown?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a> is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. It’s easy to write, easy to read, and can be easily turned into HTML. It was primarily designed for writing for the Web.</p>\n<p>It has rapidly grown in popularity and is now used in contexts never envisaged by its creator. But it’s not perfect. It has limits, especially as it leaves out formatting for a lot of HTML elements you might need to use (such as tables). It can also be a little ambiguous.</p>\n<p>As a result, a range of variants has been created to deal with these problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://commonmark.org/\">CommonMark</a> attempts to standardize Markdown and make it less ambiguous, contradicting some of the original syntaxes in the process.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.github.com/gfm/\">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a> (GFM) extends CommonMark and is used when creating documentation on GitHub.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/\">MultiMarkdown</a> added new syntax for tables, footnotes, citations, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pandoc.org/\">Pandoc</a> extends Markdown for multiple output formats (not just HTML) and supports document metadata, footnotes, tables, superscript, subscript, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some web services and Markdown editors support the syntax of some of these variants or even use their own version of Markdown. Fortunately, they all support the original Markdown syntax, and that’s what we’ll focus on in this article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learningmarkdown\">Learning Markdown</h2>\n<p>The best way to learn Markdown is simply to start. Pick a use case and begin, whether that’s creating a blog post, working on documentation, or just adding some basic formatting to your notes. Pick up the syntax piece by piece as you need it.</p>\n<p>You can use your favorite text editor, or choose one of the many apps designed to work with Markdown. Markdown editors can ease the learning process because they allow you to preview your formatting inline or in a separate pane. That means you can see at a glance whether or not you’re using the correct syntax.</p>\n<p>Personally, I use <a href=\"https://marked2app.com\">Marked 2</a> to preview Markdown files on my Mac. It&#8217;s a commercial product, but of course you can find lots of free plugins for your editor of choice. You can also edit and preview Markdown files online using <a href=\"https://markdownlivepreview.com/\">Markdown Live Preview</a> and <a href=\"https://stackedit.io/\">StackEdit</a>.</p>\n<p>For help choosing the right Markdown editor, refer to these roundup articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/the-best-markdown-editors-for-mac/\">The Best Markdown Editors for Mac</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/best-markdown-editors-windows/\">The Best Markdown Editor for Windows</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/the-best-markdown-editor-for-linux/\">The Best Markdown Editor for Linux</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"structuringdocuments\">Structuring Documents</h2>\n<p>Markdown lets you add structural elements to your document, such as <strong>headings</strong> (<code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code> etc.). There are a few ways to add headings in Markdown . My favorite is to prefix a heading with hashes <code>#</code>, one for each level of heading:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\"># Heading 1\r\n\r\n## Heading 2\r\n\r\n### Heading 3\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAnd this is body text.\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The hashes move lower-level headings further to the right, so they appear indented. You can optionally use the same number of hashes at the end of the line to close the headers:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">### Heading 3 ###\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>There’s a second way, though I don’t see it used as often. You can create two levels of headings by underlining the H1 headings with equals <code>=</code> symbols and H2 headings with hyphens <code>-</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">Heading 1 or Title\r\n==================\r\n\r\nHeading 2\r\n---------\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sections of a document can be separated using <strong>horizontal rules</strong> (<code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code>), or lines. You create these in Markdown using three (or more) hyphens <code>-</code>, asterisks <code>*</code>, underscores <code>_</code> or equals <code>=</code> signs. Place them alone on a line, with blank lines on either side:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">Brief introduction.\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\n# Chapter 1\r\n\r\nLots of text.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Chapter 2\r\n\r\nSome more text\r\n\r\n---\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Lists</strong> are another important structural element. Unordered lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) are created by beginning the line with an asterisk <code>*</code>, plus <code>+</code> symbol, or hyphen <code>-</code>, followed by a space or tab, then the text:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">* this\r\n* is\r\n* an\r\n* unordered\r\n* list\r\n\r\n+ this\r\n+ is\r\n+ too\r\n\r\n- and\r\n- so\r\n- is\r\n- this\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Choose whichever symbol suits you. You can switch between these symbols and the end result will be the same. I tend to use asterisks or hyphens.</p>\n<p>Ordered lists (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>) are numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t necessarily have to be in order. Either of these will work:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">1. this\r\n2. is\r\n3. an\r\n4. ordered\r\n5. list\r\n\r\n1. and\r\n1. so\r\n1. is\r\n1. this\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Markdown editors I use automatically continue a list when pressing <kbd>return</kbd>.</p>\n<p>If you want to start a line with a number and a period without starting a list, you need to escape the period with a backslash <code>\\</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">2020\\. A year we'll never forget.\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, paragraphs of normal text are separated by one or more blank lines:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">This will be formatted as an HTML paragraph.\r\n\r\nAnd so will this.\r\n</code></pre>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/learn-markdown/?utm_source=rss\">Learn Markdown: Structure, Syntax, and Conventions</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

We&#8217;ll also look at why we should use Lighthouse; how to use Lighthouse, both via Chrome and via the Lighthouse CLI; and the various audits Lighthouse can perform to score your web page, and why they&#8217;re important. We&#8217;ll also cover how some common performance and other website issues can be resolved.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll also look at how to use WebPageTest, another powerful tool for assessing site performance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyperformanceisimportant\">Why Performance Is Important</h2>\n<p>If you look at some of the world&#8217;s best websites, they all have one thing in common: they provide their users with a superior experience. There are many reasons for this, but one of the most important ones is performance. Users love a fast website. The longer they have to wait for a website to load, the more likely they&#8217;ll leave the website in search of a better one that allows them to do what they need to do without the wait.</p>\n<p>Improving your website&#8217;s performance can lead to a higher SEO ranking (as we&#8217;ll see in more details later in the article), and a boost in click-through and conversion rates. So, if you want more sales, sign-ups, or traffic, you&#8217;ll first have to ensure that your website&#8217;s performance is up to scratch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyuselighthouse\">Why Use Lighthouse</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse\">Lighthouse</a> is an open-source tool created by Google. As Google is a reputable company that&#8217;s trusted by many, it makes the result more reliable than other tools. Furthermore, as Google&#8217;s search engine is the leading search engine for <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/\">the past decade</a>, appearing higher on their search engine will most likely result in more traffic. So, getting a higher score on their performance audit tool can potentially raise the ranking of your website in their search results.</p>\n<p>But other than the fact that Lighthouse was created by Google, what makes it a good tool is its detailed results that have the user&#8217;s best interest at heart. Lighthouse provides many results concerning how long it takes the page to load, if the page (and ultimately the website) is secure, if the page&#8217;s accessibility practices and implementations allow for inclusivity of all users, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtouselighthouse\">How to Use Lighthouse</h2>\n<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll first go through the easiest way to use Lighthouse to analyze and check the score of a web page, which is done directly through Chrome. Then, we&#8217;ll check other Lighthouse tools that might provide even more detailed results or options.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usingchrome\">Using Chrome</h3>\n<p>Using Lighthouse through Chrome is the easiest method to measure your website&#8217;s performance. First, open any web page that you&#8217;d like to measure. To demonstrate, I&#8217;ll be using some results from an audit run on <a href=\"https://blog.shahednasser.com/\">my website</a> and on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> for us to see a variety of sample results. </p>\n<p>Next, open the devtools either by clicking <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd> on Windows/Linux, or <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> or <kbd>fn</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd> on macOS.</p>\n<p>After that, click on the <strong>Lighthouse</strong> tab.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1625062803Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-5.49.51-PM.png\" alt=\"Click on Lighthouse\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, you can choose which categories you want the audit to include. These categories are Performance, Progressive Web App, Best Practices, Accessibility, and SEO. You can also choose whether you want the audit to run on Mobile or Desktop.</p>\n<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll perform four audits which are Performance, Best Practices, Accessibility, and SEO, and we&#8217;ll run them on Desktop. However, to achieve optimal results, it&#8217;s important to test your web page under different conditions — such as on Mobile and at different internet speeds.</p>\n<p>So, on the web page you want to measure, go ahead and choose the four categories mentioned and Desktop, then click <strong>Generate Report</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1625062883Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-6.26.08-PM.png\" alt=\"Click Generate Report\" /></p>\n<p>This can take a few minutes, and you&#8217;ll see that your browser&#8217;s window might grow and shrink through the process. This is because the report entails different screen sizes and conditions for your web page. Once it&#8217;s done, the Lighthouse tab will include the result for the audit, which will include the score for each of Performance, Best Practices, Accessibility, and SEO.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1625063048Screen-Shot-2021-06-29-at-4.51.47-PM.png\" alt=\"Lighthouse Score\" /></p>\n<p>It should be noted that sometimes the results can be different based on your internet connection. Also, sometimes Lighthouse can show a notice that some extensions might have affected the result. If so, it&#8217;s probably best to run the test in an Incognito Window.</p>\n<p>When Lighthouse has finished running, you can click on any of the categories to see a more detailed report.</p>\n<h4 id=\"performance\">Performance</h4>\n<p>Performance focuses on how to make your website load faster. We&#8217;ll go over the six important metrics for Performance, what they each entail and how to achieve a better score in each of them.</p>\n<h5 id=\"firstcontentfulpaintfcp\">First Contentful Paint (FCP)</h5>\n<p>The <strong>first contentful paint</strong> (FCP) is measured from the moment the user navigates to the web page. It measures how long it takes for the first piece of DOM content to load. The DOM content can include images, non-white canvas elements, and SVG elements.</p>\n<p>FCP is measured in seconds. In order for your web page to have a &#8220;Green&#8221; score — which means a fast FCP — the first piece of DOM content should take at most 1.8 seconds to load. Once it goes above that, it can go to either moderate or slow.</p>\n<p>The reason FCP is important goes back to understanding the user. As mentioned before, users are impatient and will leave your website if it takes too long to load. A fast FCP keeps users engaged. It can be something as simple as a loading screen that tells the user to hang in tight because the web page is going to load soon.</p>\n<p>One factor that can affect your website&#8217;s FCP time is fonts. Fonts can take a long time to load, sometimes making the text invisible until it loads. A good way to solve this is by using the CSS property <code>font-display: swap;</code> when declaring your font using <code>@font-face</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">@font-face {\r\n    font-family: 'MyFont';\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n    font-weight: 400; \r\n    src: url(MyFont.woff);\r\n    font-display: swap;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using Google Fonts, this property is now enabled by default. This property allows the text to appear using the user&#8217;s system default font until the website&#8217;s font is loaded.</p>\n<p>Another factor that affects your FCP is render-blocking resources. These are usually JavaScript or CSS files that are loaded synchronously in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and take a long time to load. These resources will force the rest of the page to wait until they&#8217;re loaded before the page can fully load, thus affecting the FCP of DOM content.</p>\n<p>Here are some ways you can resolve this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Add the <code>defer</code> or <code>async</code> attributes</strong> to your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;script src=\"myScript.js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Minify the JavaScript and CSS files</strong> being used on the page, reducing its size so that loading these assets doesn&#8217;t take as long. This depends on what framework or programming language you&#8217;re using, but almost all of them have a way of doing that. You can check out <a href=\"https://web.dev/unminified-javascript/\">simple tips on how to minify JavaScript</a> when using various popular frameworks on the web.dev site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Remove unused CSS</strong> in your web page. As the amount of CSS grows in size, reducing your CSS files by removing unnecessary rules and properties that aren&#8217;t being used on a page can make it load faster. Again, there are different ways to do that based on the <a href=\"https://web.dev/unused-css-rules/\">framework</a> you&#8217;re using. However, you can use Chrome&#8217;s developer tools to view unused CSS in the <strong>Coverage</strong> tab. Using frameworks like <a href=\"http://tailwindcss.com\">Tailwind CSS</a> — which use the tree-shaking mechanism to reduce your CSS styles instead of inflating your website with many styles you&#8217;ll probably never use — can help in making your website load faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reduce the server&#8217;s response time</strong>. This can be done either by performing the logic required for the page to load using asynchronous requests, caching the data the server is frequently using, or optimizing your server code to get the required result faster.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you perform the Performance audit, if your web page has an issue with the fonts, the content-blocking resources, unused CSS, or other of the issues mentioned above, Lighthouse will highlight each file causing the issue and give tips on how it can be improved. For example, if a font is blocking the text&#8217;s visibility, Lighthouse will show you the font file that&#8217;s causing the issue and how resolving the issue will make the page&#8217;s FCP time faster.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example from the GitHub audit report that shows a CSS file as a &#8220;render-blocking resource&#8221;.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1625063688Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-8.36.33-PM.png\" alt=\"GitHub Audit\" /></p>\n<p>As you read the rest of the metrics, you&#8217;ll realize that they somehow depend on the result of this one. So, it&#8217;s important to have a good score in FCP.</p>\n<h5 id=\"timetointeractivetti\">Time to Interactive (TTI)</h5>\n<p><strong>Time to interactive</strong> (TTI) measures how long it takes for your user to be able to fully interact with the web page. The result of TTI depends on FCP, as the faster the FCP, the faster the user can interact with the web page.</p>\n<p>Users not only need to see the page loaded, but they also need to be able to interact with it. It even becomes more annoying if the website <em>seems</em> fully loaded but the user can&#8217;t interact with it properly. For example, clicking a button doesn’t do anything, even though it looks ready to use on screen. Improving your website&#8217;s TTI will make it easier for your users to use your website, which can result in a better conversion rate.</p>\n<p>In order for a web page to be considered fully active, it first needs to achieve FCP. Then, event handlers should be registered for those elements on the page that are visible. And finally, the page should be able to respond to a user&#8217;s interactions within 50ms.</p>\n<p>A web page&#8217;s TTI is measured in seconds. For a web page to have a good TTI, it should take at most 3.8 seconds to become fully interactive. If the page takes longer than that, it will either be considered moderate or slow.</p>\n<p>There are several factors that affect a web page&#8217;s TTI score. The most common are &#8220;main thread work&#8221; and &#8220;JavaScript execution time&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Main thread work</strong> means the process it takes for the browser to render a page. For the browser to render a page, it first parses the HTML, then builds the DOM, parses the CSS, and executes the JavaScript. If this process takes too long, it means it will also take long for the page to be ready to respond to the user&#8217;s interactions, as processing events is also a part of the main thread work.</p>\n<p>JavaScript execution time includes the time it takes to fetch the script, parse it, compile it, execute it, and the memory it might use. If fetching the script takes a long time due to its size, it will take a longer time to be able to parse and execute it. After the script is fetched, parsing and compiling it occurs in the main thread work, so if it takes a long time, it will slow down the main thread work. If the script has a lot of code to be executed on page load, which occurs on the main thread work, it will take a long time for the web page to be ready for the user&#8217;s interaction.</p>\n<p>Improving the TTI metric is very similar to FCP, as it relies on it first and foremost. Good practices would be to minify JavaScript and CSS files and remove any unused code in them. An additional thing you can do is to split the JavaScript and CSS files into bundles (typically done with a bundler, such as webpack). This means that the web page can fetch the bundles faster, and if you&#8217;re also using the <code>defer</code> attribute, as detailed in the previous section, it will fetch the bundles even faster asynchronously.</p>\n<h5 id=\"totalblockingtimetbt\">Total Blocking Time (TBT)</h5>\n<p>This one is pretty similar in concept to TTI. <strong>Total blocking time</strong> (TBT) measures the total time between FCP and TTI, during which various tasks block user interaction. If an individual task takes longer than 50ms, then it&#8217;s considered blocking, and the time after that point is added to the total blocking time. For example, if a particular task takes 90ms, 40ms (that is, 90ms &#8211; 50ms) is added to the TBT overall measurement .</p>\n<p>This metric basically emphasizes what TTI measures, with extra focus on which tasks are affecting the load time of your page, and how much are they affecting it.</p>\n<p>TBT is measured in milliseconds. To get a good TBT score, the total blocking time of tasks on your web page should not be more than 200ms.</p>\n<p>To improve your TBT score, it&#8217;s similar to TTI. You need to minimize main thread work and reduce JavaScript execution. However, as TBT looks more into the details of the code execution, additional enhancements could be optimizing your JavaScript code so that it works faster. For example, when selecting an element from the document, be specific in your selector rather than using a generic selector like <code>div</code>. Take a deeper look into your code, and look for any chance to improve your code, which will in turn optimize the time each task takes.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/lighthouse-beginners-guide/?utm_source=rss\">A Beginner’s Guide to Lighthouse</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Fortunately, there&#8217;s a way to make ourselves more efficient today by leveraging our existing skills to build new apps using low-code platforms. Unlike no-code, low-code platforms are more flexible and offer greater customizable features.

It runs on Node.js and is written to work with Express.js. Simply put, it&#8217;s like an open-source version of Firebase that you can run on your machine and host on your own server.</p>\n<p>The origins of the project date back to 2011, when <strong>Parse Inc</strong> was founded to provide a back-end tool for mobile developers. The startup raised $5.5 million in venture capital funding, which allowed it to grow its user base to 20,000 developers within a year.</p>\n<p>The company became so successful that it was acquired two years later by Facebook for $85 million. By 2014, the platform was hosting about 500,000 mobile apps. Unfortunately, Facebook <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/03/facebook-never-wanted-to-host-your-app-the-real-reasons-it-shut-down-parse/\">failed to invest</a> in the development of the platform and decided to shut down the service by January 2017. In order to assist its customers, Facebook open-sourced the Parse platform so as to allow developers to migrate their apps to their own self-hosted Parse server.</p>\n<p>Since then, the open-source community has continually worked on the project and has built a website, online documentation and community forum. Today, Parse provides a number of back-end features that include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>database management</li>\n<li>file object storage</li>\n<li>REST and GraphQL APIs</li>\n<li>authentication</li>\n<li>user permissions</li>\n<li>live queries (real-time data)</li>\n<li>push notifications</li>\n<li>cloud functions</li>\n<li>cloud jobs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Parse platform is mainly made up of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server\">Parse Server</a>: a headless server for building back-end apps.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard\">Parse Dashboard</a>: a front-end user interface built with React.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/parse-server-modules\">Parse Server Modules</a>: a collection of modules and adapters that extends Parse Server&#8217;s features. For example, you can install an adapter to leverage Firebase&#8217;s authentication service.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://parseplatform.org/#sdks\">Client SDKs</a>: language libraries for connecting front-end apps to Parse Server. These libraries include JavaScript, Android, Objective C, Flutter, Unity and many others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that there are several Parse projects that I haven&#8217;t mentioned here. For example, there are Android and IOS apps that provide front-end interfaces for Parse server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mongovspostgresql\">Mongo vs PostgreSQL</h2>\n<p>Parse server currently supports Mongo and PostgreSQL databases, which are the leading databases in the NoSQL and SQL spaces respectively. Both databases are quite capable, which makes it difficult to choose which one to go with.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/compare/mongodb-postgresql\">detailed guide</a> may be of assistance. In my opinion, if you&#8217;re a beginner, MongoDB is a better choice, as it&#8217;s more flexible and has a shallower learning curve. If you&#8217;re an experienced SQL developer, you&#8217;d be more productive with PostgreSQL. Below is a quick comparison for each database.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mongo\">Mongo</h3>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>flexible schema: best for new projects whose requirements aren&#8217;t fully known</li>\n<li>horizontal scalable: can easily server millions of users</li>\n<li>supports realtime data updates and reads; great for analytical applications</li>\n<li>sharding: can handle massive datasets easily</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lacks <a href=\"https://database.guide/what-is-referential-integrity/\">referential integrity</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Previous issues like ACID compliance and JOINS are now officially supported in the latest versions of MongoDB.</p>\n<h3 id=\"postgresql\">PostgreSQL</h3>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rigid schema: best for projects with known requirements and strict data integrity</li>\n<li>referential integrity/foreign key constraint support: requirement for defining table relations</li>\n<li>out-of-the-box support for ACID transactions</li>\n<li>uses SQL, the best query language for accessing and manipulating data</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>longer learning curve</li>\n<li>can only scale vertically; horizontal scaling is possible but not easy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still confused about which one to use, fortunately Back4App has an answer for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back4app\">Back4App</h2>\n<p>Back4App is a cackend-as-a-service company that hosts Parse server apps for developers at an affordable rate. It greatly simplifies the development of Parse apps. All you need to do is to <a href=\"https://www.back4app.com/\">sign up</a> for a free tier account (no credit card) to get started with 250MB of data storage and 25k requests.</p>\n<p>Paid plans offer larger resource quotas and more features such as backups, data recovery, CDN, auto scaling and high request performance. The free plan only is only recommended for learning, while the paid plans are capable of handling thousands of requests per second. See the <a href=\"https://www.back4app.com/compare-all-plans\">full pricing page</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multitenantdashboard\">Multi-tenant dashboard</h3>\n<p>Back4App allows you to create and manage multiple Parse apps on the same dashboard. This is a huge time saver compared to manually installing, configuring and hosting each parse server yourself. The difference is minutes vs hours.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163413194801-multitenant-dashboard.png\" alt=\"multi tenant dashboard\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"databasebrowser\">Database browser</h3>\n<p>Back4App uses Mongo for the database. However, it behaves as if it&#8217;s running PostgreSQL. This is great, since you get the advantages of SQL databases while using a non-SQL one — such as referential integrity, foreign key constraints and schema validation. This implementation is done in code and runs between the database and the dashboard.</p>\n<p>The database browser organizes tables (collections) as classes and data is laid out in a spreadsheet format. You can add/edit/delete/reorder columns, specify data types, and import/export data in CSV or JSON formats.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163413195302-database-browser.png\" alt=\"database browser\" /></p>\n<p>The spreadsheet interface allows you to create and edit rows of data easily. You can also upload binary files such as images or PDFs into columns that have the File data type. This is another huge time saver, as you don&#8217;t need to configure a file storage service to handle binary data. With Parse, it&#8217;s already built-in and configurable to support external file storage services.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authentication\">Authentication</h3>\n<p>Parse provides a built-in email/password authentication service. Users and roles are stored in the database and can be viewed and created via the database browser. Users can also be created programmatically via SDK, REST or GraphQL API endpoints.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a sign-up function implemented on the front end using the Parse JavaScript SDK:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function signUp() {\r\n  let user = new Parse.User();\r\n  user.set(\"username\", \"alex\");\r\n  user.set(\"password\", \"abc123\");\r\n  user.set(\"email\", \"a@abcd.com\");\r\n  try {\r\n    user.signUp(); // Everything worked and the user signed in\r\n  } catch (error) {\r\n    alert(\"Error: \" + error.code + \" \" + error.message); // Oops.. something wrong happened\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Back4App allows developers to enable <a href=\"https://www.back4app.com/docs/platform/parse-email-verification\">email verification</a> and <a href=\"https://www.back4app.com/docs/react/working-with-users/react-password-reset\">password recovery</a> features for their Parse apps. These are essential account management features that users expect when using any secure application.</p>\n<p>In addition to the default authentication method, you can enable your Parse app to authenticate using any of the following sign in methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple</li>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>GitHub</li>\n<li>Google</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>LinkedIn</li>\n<li>and many more</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"authorization\">Authorization</h3>\n<p>Authorization determines if an authenticated user has access to information stored on the database. Permissions are defined with the use of <strong>Roles</strong> and <strong>Access Controls</strong>. There are two levels of access controls:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Class-level permissions (CLP)</strong> : this type of permission protects all the data in a class(table). You can define different read and write policies for each role using CLP.</li>\n<li><strong>Object-level access control</strong>: This type of permission protects individual rows. This allows one user&#8217;s data to remain separate from another user within the same class (table). Parse also supports separating data for anonymous users using sessions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Parse uses <strong>access control lists (ACL)</strong> to protect private data from being publicly accessible. However, if the user has some data that needs to be shared publicly, a second ACL needs to be created in order to grant public access. Do note that class-level permissions will always override ACL permissions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blockchaindatabase\">Blockchain database</h3>\n<p>This is a new feature that allows storing data in a private Ethereum blockchain network. Blockchain differs from a traditional database in that, once records are inserted and verified, they can&#8217;t be updated or deleted. This has many practical implementations where trust between parties is critical in a business transaction.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163413195703-blockchain-database.png\" alt=\"blockchain database\" /></p>\n<p>At the time of writing, this <a href=\"https://www.back4app.com/docs/get-started/blockchain-data-storage\">feature</a> is still in the alpha stage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"publicdatasets\">Public Datasets</h3>\n<p>Often when building user interfaces, you&#8217;ll need to populate certain input elements with data such as list of countries, cities, zip codes, vehicle models, colors, and so on. Back4App solves this problem by providing the <a href=\"https://www.back4app.com/database\">Database Hub</a>, a list of public databases that you can freely access and use for your app.</p>\n<p>A dataset example of all the cities of the world is pictured below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163413196004-public-datasets.png\" alt=\"public datasets\" /></p>\n<p>There are three ways of accessing a public database:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can <strong>connect</strong> a public database to your app. Once the connection is successful, you can query the database via REST or GraphQL via your app. This method allows your app to receive any new updates to the schema and data.</li>\n<li>You can <strong>clone</strong> the public database to your dashboard in a new app.</li>\n<li>You can <strong>export</strong> a public database into CSV or JSON format, and then import it into your app.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last two methods allow you to modify the public datasets as you like.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livequery\">Live query</h3>\n<p>When building real-time applications, you may be forced to fetch new data every one or so seconds in order to check if there&#8217;s been any new update. This technique is known as <strong>polling</strong>, and it&#8217;s problematic, because it causes high network and server usage. Imagine if your app is being used by tens of thousands of users.</p>\n<p>Parse has a built-in protocol known as <a href=\"https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/wiki/Parse-LiveQuery-Protocol-Specification\"><strong>LiveQuery</strong></a> that allows clients to subscribe/unsubscribe to a LiveQuery server. When the relevant data is updated, the LiveQuery server pushes the new data to all clients that have subscribed to it.</p>\n<p>With Back4App, <a href=\"https://www.back4app.com/docs/platform/parse-server-live-query-example\">activating</a> the LiveQuery server is as simple as going to your App&#8217;s <strong>Server settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Server URL and Live Query</strong> and activating it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/163413196305-activate-live-query.png\" alt=\"activate live query\" /></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/parse-platform-back4app-beginner-guide/?utm_source=rss\">A Beginner’s Guide to the Parse Platform on Back4App</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Some of the rules are a little bizarre, so understanding the concepts and effect on comparison helps when debugging JavaScript applications.</p>\n<p>The following values are <strong>always falsy</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>false</code></li>\n<li><code>0</code> (zero)</li>\n<li><code>-0</code> (minus zero)</li>\n<li><code>0n</code> (<code>BigInt</code> zero)</li>\n<li><code>''</code>, <code>\"\"</code>, <code>``</code> (empty string)</li>\n<li><code>null</code></li>\n<li><code>undefined</code></li>\n<li><code>NaN</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everything else is <strong>truthy</strong>. That includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>'0'</code> (a string containing a single zero)</li>\n<li><code>'false'</code> (a string containing the text &#8220;false&#8221;)</li>\n<li><code>[]</code> (an empty array)</li>\n<li><code>{}</code> (an empty object)</li>\n<li><code>function(){}</code> (an &#8220;empty&#8221; function)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A single value can therefore be used within conditions. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">if (value) {\r\n  // value is truthy\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n  // value is falsy\r\n  // it could be false, 0, '', null, undefined or NaN\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"documentall\"><code>document.all</code></h4>\n<p>You might also see <code>document.all</code> listed as a falsy value. This returns an <code>HTMLAllCollection</code> which contains a list of all of a document&#8217;s elements. And while this evaluates to <code>false</code> in a Boolean context, it&#8217;s a deprecated feature and MDN advises against its use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1629186044truth-false4.jpg\" alt=\"Truthy and Falsy: When All is Not Equal in JavaScript\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-201720\" srcset=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1629186044truth-false4.jpg 1000w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1629186044truth-false4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1629186044truth-false4-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-truthy-falsy/?utm_source=rss\">Truthy and Falsy: When All is Not Equal in JavaScript</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

The functions are hosted and deployed by cloud computing companies. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/\">Netlify functions</a> make creating and deploying serverless functions easy for applications hosted on <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>To follow along with this tutorial, you&#8217;ll need to be familiar with JavaScript, <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue.js</a>, Git, GitHub, and <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>. You should also have a text editor — such as <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VS Code</a>) with <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur\">Vetur</a> installed (for IntelliSense) — and a recent version of Node installed on your machine. You can install Node <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">here</a>. You can check your version of Node by running the command <code>node -v</code>in your terminal.</p>\n<p>You should also have an account on Netlify. You can <a href=\"https://app.netlify.com/signup/email\">create one</a> if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatwerebuilding\">What We&#8217;re Building</h2>\n<p>To show how we can easily set up serverless functions with our front-end application, we&#8217;ll be building an app with a custom link previewer component. </p>\n<p>This component sends a request with a URL to our serverless function. The function then uses Puppeteer to get metadata from the target site using the URL and to generate a screenshot of the site. </p>\n<p>The function sends the metadata and screenshots back to the component on our front-end to display it as a link preview in the application.</p>\n<p><em>Here&#8217;s the link to the <a href=\"https://lnkpreviewr.netlify.app\">example project deployed on Netlify</a>. And here&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://github.com/miracleonyenma/link-previewer\">GitHub Repo</a> to follow along.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"createandsetupthevueapplication\">Create and Set Up the Vue Application</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to create a Vue 3 application using <a href=\"https://cli.vuejs.org/\">Vue CLI</a>. We&#8217;ll also install and set up <a href=\"https://TailwindCSS.com/\">Tailwind CSS</a>, a utility-first CSS framework that provides classes we can use for our app without having to write a lot of custom CSS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installandsetupvue\">Install and set up Vue</h3>\n<p>To quickly scaffold a Vue application, we&#8217;ll use Vue CLI. To install Vue CLI, run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install -g @vue/cli\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the CLI has been installed, we can <a href=\"https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create\">create a project</a> by running:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">vue create link-previewer\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will prompt us to pick a preset for our installation. We&#8217;ll select &#8220;Manually select features&#8221; so that we can pick the features we need. Here are the options I selected:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">Please pick a preset: Manually select features\r\n? Check the features needed for your project: Choose Vue version, Babel, PWA, Router, Vuex, Linter\r\n? Choose a version of Vue.js that you want to start the project with: 3.x\r\n? Use history mode for router? (Requires proper server setup for index fallback in production) Yes\r\n? Pick a linter / formatter config: Basic\r\n? Pick additional lint features: Lint on save\r\n? Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? In dedicated config files\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>After selecting these options, we&#8217;ll be asked if we want to save the options as a preset for later use. Select <code>Y</code> (yes) or <code>N</code> (no) and continue with the installation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636517571Linkpreviewer-vue-presets.png\" alt=\"Linkpreviewer vue presets\" /></p>\n<p>Run <code>cd link-previewer</code> to enter the newly created project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installandsetuptailwindcss\">Install and set up Tailwind CSS</h3>\n<p>To install Tailwind, we&#8217;ll use the <a href=\"https://TailwindCSS.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build\">PostCSS 7 compatibility build</a>, since Tailwind depends on PostCSS 8 — which at the time of writing is not yet supported by Vue 3. Uninstall any previous Tailwind installation and re-install the compatibility build: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm uninstall tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\r\nnpm install -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"createthetailwindconfigurationfiles\">Create the Tailwind configuration files</h4>\n<p>Next, generate <code>tailwind.config.js</code> and <code>postcss.config.js</code> files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx tailwindcss init -p\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will create a minimal <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file at the root of the project.</p>\n<h4 id=\"configuretailwindtoremoveunusedstylesinproduction\">Configure Tailwind to remove unused styles in production</h4>\n<p>In the <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file, configure the <code>purge</code> option with the paths to all of the pages and components so Tailwind can tree-shake unused styles in production builds:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// ./tailwind.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  purge: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"includetailwindinthecssfile\">Include Tailwind in the CSS file</h4>\n<p>Create the <code>./src/assets/css/main.css</code> file and use the <code>@tailwind</code> directive to include Tailwind’s <code>base</code>, <code>components</code>, and <code>utilities</code> styles:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">/* ./src/assets/css/main.css */\r\n@tailwind base;\r\n@tailwind components;\r\n@tailwind utilities;\r\n\r\nbody{\r\n  @apply bg-gray-50;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Tailwind will swap these directives out at build time with all of the styles it generates based on the  configured design system.</p>\n<p>Finally, ensure the CSS file is being imported in the <code>./src/main.js</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// ./src/main.js\r\nimport { createApp } from 'vue'\r\nimport App from './App.vue'\r\nimport './registerServiceWorker'\r\nimport router from './router'\r\nimport store from './store'\r\nimport './assets/css/main.css'\r\n\r\ncreateApp(App).use(store).use(router).mount('#app')\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that&#8217;s it, we can run our server:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm run serve\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636517548Linkpreviewer-installed-start-server.png\" alt=\"Vue CLI: start the server after successfully creating an app\" /></p>\n<p>Now that the app is running, if we go to the URL provided, we should see the default demo app for Vue and see that Tailwind&#8217;s <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight\">preflight base styles</a> have been applied.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636517535Linkpreviewer-default-app-tailwind.png\" alt=\"Vue app output after adding Tailwind CSS\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"installtailwindcssintellisenseextension\">Install Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension</h4>\n<p>For a smoother development experience, install the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss\">Tailwind CSS Intellisense extension</a> for VS Code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636517565Linkpreviewer-tailwind-intellisens-vetur.png\" alt=\"Install Tailwind CSS Intellisense Extension for VS Code\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"basicappstructure\">Basic app structure</h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of what our project folder should look like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">link-previewer/\r\n├─ functions/\r\n│  ├─ generate-preview.js\r\n│  └─ hello.js\r\n├─ public/\r\n│  ├─ favicon.ico\r\n│  ├─ img/\r\n│  │  └─ icons/\r\n│  ├─ index.html\r\n│  └─ robots.txt\r\n├─ src/\r\n│  ├─ main.js\r\n│  ├─ App.vue\r\n│  ├─ registerServiceWorker.js\r\n│  ├─ assets/\r\n│  │  ├─ css/\r\n│  │  │  └─ main.css\r\n│  │  └─ logo.png\r\n│  ├─ components/\r\n│  │  └─ LinkPreviewer.vue\r\n│  ├─ router/\r\n│  │  └─ index.js\r\n│  ├─ store/\r\n│  │  └─ index.js\r\n│  └─ views/\r\n│     ├─ About.vue\r\n│     └─ Home.vue\r\n├─ .git\r\n├─ .gitignore\r\n├─ .browserslistrc\r\n├─ .eslintrc.js\r\n├─ babel.config.js\r\n├─ netlify.toml\r\n├─ package-lock.json\r\n├─ package.json\r\n├─ postcss.config.js\r\n├─ README.md\r\n└─ tailwind.config.js\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"aquickintroductiontonetlifyfunctions\">A Quick Introduction to Netlify Functions</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/\">Netlify Functions</a> is a Netlify product that simplifies the process of creating and deploying serverless functions. According to the product&#8217;s home page, it&#8217;s used to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deploy server-side code that works as API endpoints, runs automatically in response to events, or processes more complex jobs in the background. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A basic Netlify Function file exports a handler method with the following syntax:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">exports.handler = async function(event, context){\r\n  return {\r\n    statusCode: 200,\r\n    body: JSON.stringify({message: \"Hello World!\"})\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Netlify provides the <code>event</code> and <code>context</code> parameters when the function is called/invoked. When a function&#8217;s endpoint is called, the <code>handler</code> receives an <code>event</code> object like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\r\n  \"path\": \"Path parameter (original URL encoding)\",\r\n  \"httpMethod\": \"Incoming request’s method name\",\r\n  \"headers\": {Incoming request headers},\r\n  \"queryStringParameters\": {Query string parameters},\r\n  \"body\": \"A JSON string of the request payload\",\r\n  \"isBase64Encoded\": \"A boolean flag to indicate if the applicable request payload is Base64-encoded\"\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>context</code> parameter, on the other hand, includes information about the context in which the function was called.</p>\n<p>Within the function, we&#8217;re returning an object with two important properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>statusCode</code>, which is <code>200</code> in this case</li>\n<li><code>body</code>, which is a <em>stringified</em> object.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The function will be called from our site at <code>/.netlify/functions/hello</code> and on success, it would return the 200 status code and the message, “Hello, World!”. </p>\n<p>Now that we have an idea of how Netlify functions work, let&#8217;s see them in practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingourfirstnetlifyfunction\">Creating Our First Netlify Function</h2>\n<p>To create our first Netlify function, we&#8217;ll create a new file <code>functions/hello.js</code> in the project directory and enter the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// functions/hello.js\r\nexports.handler = async function(event, context){\r\n  return {\r\n    statusCode: 200,\r\n    body: JSON.stringify({message: \"Hello World!\"})\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once we&#8217;ve created the function file, we have to make some necessary configurations in order for us to run our function locally.</p>\n<h3 id=\"setupnetlifyconfiguration\">Set up Netlify configuration</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll create a <code>netlify.toml</code> file at the root of our project folder that will tell Netlify where to find our functions: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"toml language-toml\"># ./netlify.toml\r\n\r\n[functions]\r\n  directory = \"./functions\"\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Netlify will now locate and deploy the functions in the <code>functions</code> folder at build time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installnetlifycli\">Install Netlify CLI</h2>\n<p>To run our functions locally without having to deploy to Netlify, we need to install <a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/\">Netlify CLI</a>. The CLI allows us to deploy our projects with some great Netlify features locally. </p>\n<p>To install the CLI, make sure you have <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">Node.js</a> version 10 or later, then run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install netlify-cli -g\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This installs Netlify CLI globally, so we can run <code>netlify</code> commands from any directory. To get the version, usage, and so on, we can run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">netlify \r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"runtheappwithnetlifydev\">Run the App with Netlify Dev</h2>\n<p>To run our project locally with Netlify CLI, stop the dev server (if it&#8217;s active), then run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">netlify dev\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here&#8217;s what we should see:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636517551Linkpreviewer-Netlif-CLI-dev.png\" alt=\"Run Netlify dev with Netlify CLI\" /></p>\n<p>If you look closely, you&#8217;ll see a few things going on there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Netlify tries to inject environment variables from our <code>.env</code> files into the build process, which can then be accessed by our Netlify Functions. In this case, we have no <code>.env</code> file, so it loads the defaults defined in <code>process</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Secondly, it loads or deploys our functions located in the functions directory. The Functions server is deployed on a different and random port — <code>36647</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lastly, it automatically detects what framework the application is built with and runs the necessary build processes to deploy the application. In this case, you can see &#8220;Starting Netlify Dev with Vue.js&#8221;. It also supports React and other popular frameworks.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Netlify then starts our development server on <code>http://localhost:8888</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636517554Linkpreviewer-netlify-dev-server-started.png\" alt=\"Netlify dev Cli started\" /></p>\n<p>Now that our server has started and our functions arevloaded, we can call/invoke it. By default, we can access our functions using this route: <code>/.netlify/functions/&lt;function name&gt;</code>. </p>\n<p>One important thing to note is that we don&#8217;t need to specify the port where our Functions server is running. We can use the default route above to communicate with our Functions server. Netlify automatically resolves the URL and port behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>if we send a <code>GET</code> request to <a href=\"http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello\">http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello</a>, we should get a response of <code>{\"message\":\"Hello, World!\"}</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636517543Linkpreviewer-hello-function.png\" alt=\"hello.js Function response from browser\" /></p>\n<p>Great!

This architecture has significantly simplified the process of creating routes within a website. In this tutorial, we&rsquo;ll learn how to set up a Next.js project and how the system of file routing in Next.js works.</strong></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll also learn how to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>create static and dynamic pages</li>\n<li>implement page transition with <code>Link</code>, as well as some of its props</li>\n<li>use the <code>useRouter()</code> hook to obtain query param from the URL</li>\n<li>nest routes dynamically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>… and a lot more.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll learn all of this by building a portfolio page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_0\">Next.js Features</h2>\n<p>Next.js is a React-based web framework built on top on Node.js. Since it&rsquo;s based on React, it also follows the component architectural design.</p>\n<p>Next.js can be used to build <strong>static sites</strong>. These are sites with pages that get pre-rendered and served to the user at build time. In simple terms, the page is available even before the user requests it.</p>\n<p>It also allows for the use of server-side rendering to generate dynamic web pages (pages that change every time a user makes a fresh request). </p>\n<p>The architecture of routing in Next.js makes it very easy to create and link pages together. We can dynamically pass query parameters, and create dynamic pages without having to leave the <code>pages</code> folder.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc_1\">Why use Next.js</h3>\n<p>The Next.js framework was first released on October 25, 2016. Since then, it&rsquo;s gone on to become one of the most popular web frameworks, for a couple of reasons.</p>\n<p>For one, Next.js is fundamentally React. This is great news for the huge community of developers who come from a React background. Developers can still make use of some React features like the component architecture, JSX and more.</p>\n<p>Second is the ability to <strong>pre-render</strong> pages using Next. By default, Next.js generates all pages in advance, which will then be reused on every user request. Since the site is pre-generated, search engine crawlers can properly index the site for SEO.</p>\n<p>As said, one very useful feature is the system of file routing in Next.js, which has significantly simplified the process of creating routes within a website. So you can basically create a bunch of <code>.js</code> files inside a single folder named <code>pages</code>, which Next.js will use for all your routes. Not only is it useful, but it&rsquo;s very powerful as well. </p>\n<h3 id=\"toc_2\">The Project</h3>\n<p>The site will have two simple routes and two dynamic routes (we&rsquo;ll get to the meaning of those later). </p>\n<p>The <code>Projects</code> page will render a list of projects. Upon clicking on <strong>view more</strong>, we&rsquo;ll  be directed to a single project page. </p>\n<p>The <code>blog</code> page will render a list of blog posts, and we can also view a single blog page by clicking <strong>Read more</strong>. The page will contain details about a specific post. </p>\n<p>To demonstrate <strong>route nesting</strong> in Next, we&rsquo;ll also create a nested <code>/comments</code> route for each blog post. For example, we can view the comments for the first post by visiting <code>localhost:3000/blog/first-post/comments</code>.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the live preview for the project:<!-- https://hy56m.sse.codesandbox.io/ --></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/next-portfolio-forked-ww4b9?fontsize=14&#038;hidenavigation=1&#038;theme=dark\"\n style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n title=\"next-portfolio (forked)\"\n allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"></iframe> </p>\n<p>You can get the code from its <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/next-portfolio\">GitHub repository</a><!--https://github.com/KingsleyUbah/next-portfolio-->, run it on your machine and tweak it as you wish. You can delete my images and move yours to the <code>/public</code> folder. You only need to change the filenames in the markup.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_3\">Getting Started</h2>\n<p>To get started with Next, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. The version of Node should not be lower than <code>12.x</code>. You can check for the version by typing <code>node -v</code> on the command terminal. </p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have Node.js installed, or have an older version, you can download the latest version from <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>After it&rsquo;s downloaded, we&rsquo;ll need to initialize our project. We can do this either automatically or manually. In this tutorial, we&rsquo;ll be using the <code>create-next-app</code> code generator to automatically build a working framework for us.</p>\n<p>Please navigate to the folder you want the project to live in and type in the following command:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">cd your/path\r\nnpx create-next-app next-portfolio</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Finally, run the following command:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm run dev</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>You should see the following on your terminal window, if all went well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633695424compilesuccess.png\" alt=\"Project all set\"/></p>\n<p>We can view the page on the web browser at <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633695445nexthome.png\" alt=\"Next project now live\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"toc_4\">The File-based Architecture of Routing in Next.js</h2>\n<p>When we ran that command, we created a folder named <code>next-portfolio</code> inside the current directory. Inside <code>next-portfolio</code>, you&rsquo;ll find some important folders and files.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633695473understand-next-files.png\" alt=\"App directory structure\"/></p>\n<p>The folder we&rsquo;ll be working in most frequently is <code>pages</code>. In Next, every <code>.js</code> file defined inside <code>pages</code> maps to a similarly named route:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pages/about.js</code> will map to <code>/about</code></li>\n<li><code>pages/contact.js</code> will map to <code>/contact</code></li>\n<li><code>pages/blog.js</code> will map to <code>/blog</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a high-level representation of the pages folder inside a typical Next project:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">my-site\r\n\r\n└── pages\r\n\r\n    └── api // API routes\r\n\r\n    ├── _app.js // custom route (will **not** be used as a route)\r\n\r\n    ├── index.js // index route (will be rendered at my-site.com)\r\n\r\n    ├── about.js // predefined route (will be rendered at my-site.com/about)\r\n\r\n    ├── contact.js // predefined route (will be rendered at my-site.com/contact)\r\n\r\n    └── blog\r\n\r\n        ├── index.js // index route for blog (will be rendered at my-site.com/blog) \r\n\r\n        ├── author.js // predefined route (will be rendered at my-site.com/blog/author)\r\n\r\n        ├── [blog-id].js // handles dynamic route (will render dynamcially, based on the url parameter)\r\n\r\n        └── [...slug].js // handles catch all route (will be rendered at all routes following my-site.com/blog)</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Each React component will be bundled as a <code>.js</code> file, containing markup and logic for each page. </p>\n<h3 id=\"toc_5\">The public folder</h3>\n<p>Next.js provides a public folder where you can store static assets like images, custom scripts and fonts, and refer to them from your components/code.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll be using the following images in various pages on our portfolio site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A personal photo. This will be used on the home page (<code>index.js</code>).</li>\n<li>Four social media icons. This will be used on the contact page (<code>contact.js</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"toc_6\">Custom pages</h3>\n<p>You may have noticed the page <code>_app.js</code> in your pages folder. This page is a custom page. Custom pages are <em>not</em> used as routes by Next.js, and they&rsquo;re prefixed with an underscore (<code>_</code>).</p>\n<p>Next.js uses the <code>_app.js</code> to initialize the web page. This component initializes the app and passes down the <code>pageProps</code> prop, which is the data needed by all nested components in our website.</p>\n<p>Being the root component, we can define a layout that we want to persist across all pages. </p>\n<p>We can also use a global stylesheet that applies to all elements, like in the following example:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">//next-portfolio/pages/_app.js\r\n\r\nimport Layout from &#39;../components/Layout&#39;\r\nimport &#39;../styles/globals.css&#39;\r\n\r\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Layout&gt;\r\n      &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Layout&gt;\r\n  ); \r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MyApp</code></pre>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"toc_7\">Index routes</h3>\n<p>Whenever we navigate to index routes (aka home pages) such as <code>my-site.com</code>, <code>my-site.com/blog</code>, or <code>my-site.com/projects</code>, Next.js will read any files from inside that directory named <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n<p>So in essence, <code>pages/index.js</code> returns the markup for the home page, which is displayed at <code>localhost:3000</code>. <code>pages/blog/index.js</code> returns the markup for the blog home page, which is at <code>localhost:3000/blog</code>.</p>\n<p>In your code editor, please go to the index page and delete all of the file content. The following markup is used for testing purpose:</p>\n<div>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// next-portfolio/pages/index.js\r\n\r\nimport Image from &#39;next/image&#39;\r\nimport Link from &#39;next/link&#39;\r\n\r\nexport default function Home() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div className=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \r\n    )\r\n}</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p><em>Note: move into <code>next-portfolio/styles</code> in your text editor, and delete <code>Home.module.css</code>, as we won&rsquo;t be needing it at all.</em></p>\n<p>Now save the file changes and open <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a>. The changes in the index file will reflect on the index route.</p>\n<p><img style=\"box-shadow: 3px 3px 7px #ddd7d7\" src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633695429helloworld.png\" alt=\"Hello world\"/></p>\n<p>So much more will go into the <code>index.js</code> file. The top section of the home page will hold navigation links. However, it is more intuitive to build other pages before the home page, so we can link to them properly.</p>\n<p>For that reason, we&rsquo;ll need to first create some of the other pages before building our home page.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/routing-in-next-js-beginner-guide/?utm_source=rss\">A Beginner’s Guide to Routing in Next.js, with Examples</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

            "\n<p>Websites change. Healthy codebases are constantly being updated. Legacy code dies when it eventually goes down with the ship. Recognizing that my code is transient allows me to be more practical about my code and what guides my decision-making as I author it. </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-357600\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h3>Your code is transient.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to think that code changes stem from one of two causes: code decay or website relevance.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns ticss-c57c5cc8\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"h-code-decay\">Code decay&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The code we write follows specifications from authorities like web browsers or frameworks. It can also be based on requirements from a business or organization the website is for. All of these rules change as our websites and their contexts evolve. I think of this as code decay. Maybe an HTML spec is adopted by browsers allowing our markup to become more semantic, or perhaps we’re using a framework and want to upgrade to the latest major version. Maybe a business needs to change payment providers, or perhaps there&#8217;s a new security requirement we need to adopt. Our code frequently needs to be maintained in order to keep up and, at times, keep working. Occasionally, we can get by without changing it for long periods of time, but there is always a point at which old code needs either to be changed or disposed of.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"h-website-relevance\">Website relevance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s face it, our website is not as cool as it used to be. Maybe this is because the design has grown old, or perhaps what it does is less important to people than it was before. Maybe there&#8217;s a new requirement and feature that needs to be added, or perhaps we’re just tired of staring at it. Redesign! Rebrand! Iterate! It is unreasonable to expect most websites to stay relevant without changing their content or code significantly over time. We should expect our code to do the same and change over time—especially on the front end.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large ticss-f44e02c9\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"813\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1720536811-removebg.png?resize=1024%2C813&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-358227\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1720536811-removebg.png?resize=1024%2C813&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1720536811-removebg.png?resize=300%2C238&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1720536811-removebg.png?resize=768%2C610&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1720536811-removebg.png?resize=1536%2C1220&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1720536811-removebg.png?resize=2048%2C1626&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1720536811-removebg.png?resize=1000%2C794&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shutterstock_1720536811-removebg.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-accepting-change\">Accepting change</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality of change seems like a fairly obvious thing to acknowledge, however, I find it to be a helpful reminder as someone who has a tendency to go off coding as if I am building The Great Pyramid of Giza. Coding is often much more like setting up camp, not knowing if we will be staying for a few days or a year. I try to start with the assumption that it will be brief, and settle in over time. Consider picking up some overpriced water at the store before we dig an entire well. So often I find myself in a frenzied relocation days after pitching my tent. I do not need to look much further back than a few months to find code I have written that already needs to change. It doesn’t need to change because I didn’t do it good enough the first time—it’s just time to change it! How should this influence the way we code or think about our code? Here are a few thoughts I have adopted recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-write-transient-code\">1) Write transient code.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing that my code may change in the near future allows me to focus on its current purpose and ensuring its footprint is isolated. It has freed me to focus on the code in front of me and not be distracted by the possible future timelines of the code I am writing. This is particularly applicable for large portions of small projects. For large projects, you can apply this principle to pieces of your codebase. If you have used a component in a library for an entire year, often its requirements have changed over time. Removing the cruft of the past can help give it purpose for the immediate future. I often find writing a replacement component to be quicker than updating an old one, and the result to be easier to use and understand. Where applicable, I try to replace instead of rehabilitate. When I create something new, I prioritize the present, trusting that I will give myself space to solve future problems later on. Future problems are often best solved in the future because you tend to have more facts and fewer assumptions the closer you are to the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-when-possible-avoid-dependencies\">2) When possible, avoid dependencies.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>More and more I am drawn towards built-in browser functionality and have a high bar when justifying the use of frameworks. At certain scales dependencies are unavoidable and frequently more efficient in collaborative environments. When I do use them, I try to isolate or wrap their functionality so that it is easier to untangle later on if I need to. If you can justify the effort of writing your own code, you become more familiar with web specifications and learn just how robust they are on their own. You also end up with something that can be easier to maintain long-term because it is closest to the core evolutionary path of the web. There is no dependency upgrade between your code and ever-evolving browser functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"h-let-the-code-die\">3) Let the code die.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While this is only an acceptable outcome for situations that don’t require change for important reasons, like usability, this is my favorite thing to do when it makes sense. Let things get old. Don’t intend on updating them. Creative projects and demos are a great case for this. By letting old projects die, I am acknowledging that their value was very much tied to the moment of time they existed within. Not everything needs to be around forever&nbsp;(spoiler,&nbsp;nothing we make will be around forever). If something is important and you want to preserve it, capture its meaningfulness through screen recordings and documentation, and then move on. This has allowed me to proceed to the next the thing more freely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-moving-forward\">Moving forward</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the most meditative and rejuvenating thing I can do as someone who writes code is to reflect on the fact that the code I write is transient. So often this space can be highly combative when we talk about tooling, best practices, and the new hot thing. A spirit of urgency to adopt the&nbsp;“best”&nbsp;approach applies immense amounts of pressure as we plan out projects. We speak in absolutes with an air of permanence and often overlook just how dated our opinions are going to sound in the near future. The stakes are ultimately never as high as they feel when you are making decisions about tooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I prefer to be in a place where I am continually recognizing that the code I write is temporary, that technology is growing faster than I can individually match pace, and that I will never need to have expertise in all things. It is here that I find comfort in knowing the best code I write is in front of me and that the best website I can make right now is the next one.</p>\n"

This gives rise to the need for reusable source code called “code snippets”. These snippets prevent repetitive code during programming, can be saved for future use, and are sharable.</strong> </p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll build a website to help users save daily code snippets using the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> web development framework, and powered by the <a href=\"https://fauna.com/\">Fauna</a> database to handle the storage, manipulation, and display of code snippets. By working on this fun project, we&#8217;ll also learn how to create a basic CRUD app with Next.js and FaunaDB that could also be used for building other similar projects.</p>\n<p>A working version of this project can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/CodeSnippet-app\">GitHub</a>. To follow along, you&#8217;ll need <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Node installed on your machine</a>, as well as a FaunaDB account and a Google account (for authentication).</p>\n<h2 id=\"installingdependencies\">Installing Dependencies</h2>\n<p>In this section, we’ll look at how to install Next.js using the <code>npx create-next-app</code> command. This will initialize the Next CLI and build a new Next.js application.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll also install the dependencies we&#8217;ll be using for the back end — FaunaDB and SWR — via the command line. SWR (state-while-revalidate) is a Next.js hook for fetching data. We&#8217;ll go into this in depth later in this tutorial.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nextjsinstallation\">Next.js installation</h3>\n<p>To install Next.js, enter the following command in the CLI:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx create-next-app snippetapp\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above command creates a project directory called <code>snippetapp</code> with the Next.js starter template, which contains the required files for coding with Next. When Next has finished installing, change into the newly created directory:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd snippetapp\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"faunadbandswrinstallation\">FaunaDB and SWR installation</h3>\n<p>To install Fauna, we&#8217;ll be using the following command in the CLI:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install --save faunadb\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then to install SWR:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install swr@0.3.8\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this, we&#8217;ve installed all the dependencies we&#8217;ll be using to build our application and can now proceed to set up our database on Fauna.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faunadbsetup\">FaunaDB Setup</h2>\n<p>FaunaDB is a serverless, real-time database. It transforms a traditional database into a flexible data API that still retains the capabilities of a database and its performance while delivering secure and scalable access to app data.</p>\n<p>Here, we&#8217;ll create a user account and set up the database to store the data we&#8217;ll be using in our snippet application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creatingauseraccount\">Creating a user account</h3>\n<p>To create a user account, navigate to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register\">Fauna signup page</a> and create an account.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634823530fauna-signup.jpg\" alt=\"Creating a FaunaDB account\" /></p>\n<p>After creating a user account, you&#8217;ll be redirected to the dashboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634823499after-signup.jpg\" alt=\"The FaunaDB dashboard\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"createthesnippetdatabaseandcollection\">Create the snippet database and collection</h3>\n<p>Here, we&#8217;ll create a database with the collections required to manage the code snippets of our application. Click on <strong>CREATE DATABASE</strong>. We&#8217;ll create a database called <code>snippets</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634823508create-a-db.jpg\" alt=\"Creating a FaunaDB snippets database\" /></p>\n<p>On the new page that opens, click on <strong>NEW COLLECTION</strong> and create a collection called <code>codesnippet</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634823505collection.jpg\" alt=\"collection page\" /></p>\n<p>After creating a collection, we get a page where we can create a document.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634823527document-page.jpg\" alt=\"Create a document\" /></p>\n<p>Here, you&#8217;ll click on <strong>NEW DOCUMENT</strong>. A JSON document will open, where you can enter the details, as pictured below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634823533new-document.jpg\" alt=\"Document creation\" /></p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\r\n  name: \"Prompt User\",\r\n  description: \"prompts the user\",\r\n  language: \"javascript\",\r\n  code: \"prompt('would you like to continue')\"\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we define a snippet with attributes: <code>name</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>language</code> and <code>code</code>. Click on <strong>SAVE</strong> to save the new collection. We&#8217;ve successfully added a snippet to our database. Now we can proceed to getting our access credentials to use on our app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"secretkeycreation\">Secret key creation</h3>\n<p>On the dashboard, click on <strong>Security</strong>. This opens up a new page to create our security key.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1634823524creating-a-key.jpg\" alt=\"Creating a FaunaDB security key\" /></p>\n<p>Here, we&#8217;ll set the role to “server” instead of “admin”, and you can give the key a name. Click on the <strong>SAVE</strong> button to generate your key.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creatingaenvfile\">Creating a <code>.env</code> file</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll now create a <code>.env</code> file within the directory of our project. This file will store our generated secret key. In the <code>.env</code> file we have this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">FAUNA_SECRET = paste your key here\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"creatingacodesnippetpage\">Creating a Code Snippet Page</h2>\n<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll build the display and upload page for the snippets, and also add functionality to it.</p>\n<p>Open the project directory in your code editor and navigate to the <code>index.js</code> file in your pages folder. Here we’ll clear out the code and start building our application:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import Head from \"next/head\"\r\nimport Image from \"next/image\"\r\nimport styles from \"../styles/Home.module.css\"\r\n\r\nexport default function Home() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div className={styles.container}&gt;\r\n      &lt;Head&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;View Snippet&lt;/title&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"Generated by create next app\" /&gt;\r\n        &lt;link rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\" /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Head&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;main className={styles.main}&gt;\r\n        &lt;h1 className={styles.title}&gt;Re-usuable Code Snippets&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n        &lt;p className={styles.info}&gt;Add your code snippets here...&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;button&gt;Create new snippet&lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;/main&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"creatingourcomponents\">Creating our Components</h3>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ll create a component file that will render our snippets. Create a folder named <code>component</code> in your working directory and create a file named <code>Snippets.js</code> within it with the following code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import React from \"react\"\r\nimport styles from \"../styles/Home.module.css\"\r\n\r\nfunction Snippets() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div className={styles.cont}&gt;\r\n      &lt;p className={styles.lang}&gt;language&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;h3 className={styles.name}&gt;name of snippet&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n      &lt;p className={styles.descp}&gt;description of snippet&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      {/* Code will be displayed here*/}\r\n      &lt;div className={styles.links}&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Snippets\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"importingourcomponentsintotheapp\">Importing our components into the app</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll now add imports for this file in our <code>index.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import Snippets from \"../components/Snippets\"\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>And use it in our app:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">&lt;button&gt;Create new snippet&lt;/button&gt;\r\n&lt;Snippets/&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"stylingourapp\">Styling our app</h3>\n<p>We can now style our page. Navigate to the <code>Home.module.css</code> file in the <code>styles</code> folder and replace the styles there with the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.container{\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  min-height: 100vh;\r\n  background: rgb(48, 48, 255);\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n  align-items: center;\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n  font-family: Montserrat;\r\n}\r\n.cont{\r\n  color: #333;\r\n  margin-top: 5px;\r\n  background: rgb(214, 214, 214);\r\n  border-radius: 15px;\r\n  padding: 10px 15px;\r\n}\r\n.main button{\r\n  width: fit-content;\r\n  flex-grow: unset;\r\n  display: inline-block;\r\n  padding: 5px 10px;\r\n  outline: none;\r\n  border: none;\r\n  border-radius: 5%;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: rgb(48, 48, 255);\r\n}\r\n.main button:hover{\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n}\r\n.links{\r\n  margin-top: 10px;\r\n}\r\n.links a{\r\n  margin-left: 5px;\r\n}\r\n.links a:hover{\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"viewingourapp\">Viewing Our App</h2>\n<p>At this point, you should be able to start the dev server with <code>npm run dev</code>, visit <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a>, and see the skeleton of our app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"settingupthesnippetdisplayarea\">Setting up the Snippet Display Area</h2>\n<p>Next, we&#8217;ll create the display section for the snippet code. Create a new file called <code>Code.js</code> in the components folder and import it into <code>Snippets.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import React from 'react'\r\nimport styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'\r\nimport Code from \"./Code\";\r\n\r\nfunction Snippets() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div className={styles.cont}&gt;\r\n      &lt;p className={styles.lang}&gt;language&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;h3 className={styles.name}&gt;name of snippet&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n      &lt;p className={styles.descp}&gt;description of snippet&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n      {/* Code will be displayed here*/}\r\n      &lt;Code /&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;div className={styles.links}&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Snippets\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>For the syntax highlighting of the code, we&#8217;ll be using two packages, namely <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-syntax-highlighter\">react-syntax-highlighter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-copy-to-clipboard\">react-copy-to-clipboard</a>. We can download this via the CLI:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install react-syntax-highlighter react-copy-to-clipboard --save\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then in <code>Code.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import React from \"react\"\r\nimport { PrismLight as SyntaxHighlighter } from \"react-syntax-highlighter\"\r\nimport {atomDark} from \"react-syntax-highlighter/dist/cjs/styles/prism\"\r\nimport { CopyToClipboard } from \"react-copy-to-clipboard\"\r\nimport styles from \"../styles/Home.module.css\"\r\nfunction Code() {\r\n  const codeString = \"npm install import react from 'react'\"\r\n  const [show, setshow] = React.useState(false)\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setshow(!show)}&gt;Show Code&lt;/button&gt;\r\n      {show ? (\r\n        &lt;div&gt;\r\n          &lt;CopyToClipboard text={codeString}&gt;\r\n            &lt;button className={styles.btn}&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;\r\n          &lt;/CopyToClipboard&gt;\r\n          &lt;SyntaxHighlighter language=\"javascript\" style={atomDark}&gt;\r\n            {codeString}\r\n          &lt;/SyntaxHighlighter&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      ) : null}\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\nexport default Code\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we created a component to display code with syntax highlighting. We&#8217;ve also added copy and toggle-show functionality. Now in the <code>styles</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">.btn{\r\n  left: 80%;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"testingthecodeblocks\">Testing the Code Blocks</h2>\n<p>To view this change, you can run <code>npm run dev</code> in the command line and view it in your browser. We have the string &#8220;npm install import react from &#8216;react'&#8221; displayed with syntax highlighting as a code block. There&#8217;s also a button to hide and display the code snippet, and a button that allows us to copy the code from the code block.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faunadbinitialization\">FaunaDB Initialization</h2>\n<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll fetch data from our FaunaDB database to our app. Create a file called <code>Fauna.js</code> in your project directory:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const faunadb = require(\"faunadb\")\r\nconst faunaClient = new faunadb.Client({\r\n  secret: process.env.FAUNA_SECRET\r\n})\r\nconst q = faunadb.query\r\nconst getResponse = async () =&gt; {\r\n  const { data } = await faunaClient.query(\r\n    q.Map(\r\n      q.Paginate(q.Documents(q.Collection(\"codesnippet\"))),\r\n      q.Lambda(\"doc\", q.Get(q.Var(\"doc\")))\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n  const snippets = data.map((snippet) =&gt; {\r\n    snippet.id = snippet.ref.id\r\n    delete snippet.ref\r\n    return snippet\r\n  })\r\n  return snippets\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  getResponse,\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we&#8217;ve initialized FaunaDB with our secret key. We&#8217;ve also set up an <code>async</code> request to query our collection and return the data. We&#8217;ve stored the returned data in a variable named <code>snippets</code>, and deleted the ref to better structure the data. Other functionalities for creating, updating and deleting snippets will be added later in this tutorial.</p>\n<p>Note that, if you&#8217;re getting an unauthorized error in the console, you may need to specify the domain name of the target endpoint. The default is <code>db.fauna.com</code>, but since the introduction of <a href=\"https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/learn/understanding/region_groups\">Region Groups</a>, three cloud domains are available. Use the correct domain for your database’s Region Group:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic (US and EU): <code>db.fauna.com</code></li>\n<li>United States (US): <code>db.us.fauna.com</code></li>\n<li>Europe (EU): <code>db.eu.fauna.com</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const faunaClient = new faunadb.Client({\r\n  secret: process.env.FAUNA_SECRET,\r\n  domain: \"db.eu.fauna.com\"\r\n})\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"handlingourapirequests\">Handling our API requests</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll also create a file to handle our API request for our database. Within the <code>api</code> folder in <code>pages</code>, create a file called <code>snippets.js</code> with the following code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import { getResponse } from \"../../Fauna.js\"\r\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\r\n  console.log(req)\r\n  if (req.method !== \"GET\") {\r\n    return res.status(405)\r\n  }\r\n  try {\r\n    const snippets = await getResponse()\r\n    return res.status(200).json(snippets)\r\n  } catch (err) {\r\n    console.log(err)\r\n      res.status(500).json({ msg: \"Something went wrong.\" })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Above, we&#8217;ve simply set up a function to handle requests from our database. The snippets are returned as <code>Json</code> and will log errors if any occur. In Next.js, any file stored in the <code>api</code> folder is treated as API endpoints rather than a page and is rendered server-side.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/nextjs-faunadb-build-code-snippet-app/?utm_source=rss\">Build a Code Snippet Web App with Next.js and FaunaDB</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Auto sync is nice in that all your images (even your entire <em>existing</em> media library) is synced up to Cloudinary and stays in sync. This is necessary to host your images (and do fancy optional stuff like &#8220;transforms&#8221;) but you could otherwise think of it as a backup. When you use &#8220;Cloudinary and WordPress&#8221; as the Storage setting, it means that media will be uploaded to your own server and Cloudinary. That&#8217;s what I would highly recommend, but if you&#8217;re in a situation where, say, you have very limited or no storage on your WordPress host, you could have the images go straight to Cloudinary (only).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1964\" height=\"1582\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-23-at-8.22.18-PM.png?resize=1964%2C1582&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-357699\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-23-at-8.22.18-PM.png?w=1964&amp;ssl=1 1964w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-23-at-8.22.18-PM.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-23-at-8.22.18-PM.png?resize=1024%2C825&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-23-at-8.22.18-PM.png?resize=768%2C619&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-23-at-8.22.18-PM.png?resize=1536%2C1237&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-23-at-8.22.18-PM.png?resize=1000%2C805&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Image settings, you can see two of Cloudinary&#8217;s most powerful weapons: <code>f_auto</code> and <code>q_auto</code>, standing for &#8220;auto image formatting&#8221; and &#8220;auto quality compression.&#8221; Those are defaults I&#8217;d highly recommend leaving alone. It means that any browser on any device gets the best possible format of the image, and Cloudinary adjusts the quality as appropriate for that image. Cloudinary has very good tech for doing this, so let it do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-doing-images-right-checklist-is-a-thing\">The &#8220;doing images right&#8221; checklist is a thing. </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TCSDGFI3TTTTTTFY4NKC4TTTTTT2FX67K6TTTTTTY4K7AYVTTTTTTSIHFHC6CM7IG6YMCYZ7CM76KKIEPHV6VIP32M4E\" rel=\"nofollow\">we blogged it just recently</a>. Host them on a CDN. Optimze them. Serve them in the best possible format for the requesting browser. Use responsive images. Lazy load them. None of those things are trivial, and that&#8217;s just a partial list. The good news is: this plugin does <em>all that stuff</em> for you, does it well, and does it without you having to think too much about it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1296\" height=\"874\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-23-at-8.31.41-PM.png?resize=1296%2C874&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Showing the source HTML code for an image block.

This is where the rubber meets the road. From this I can see that responsive images are implemented correctly and lots of different sizes are available. I can see the the image sources are pointing at the Cloudinary CDN. I can see lazy loading is implemented and working. I can see the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes are there as they should be to ensure space is reserved for the images during loading. This is everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It goes the extra mile by hosting the images the used by the theme as well.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Heck, it replaces CSS <code>background-image</code>s in your theme&#8217;s stylesheet with Cloudinary-hosted versions. That&#8217;s&#8230; amazing. There must be some real clever WordPress filter stuff going on. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2714\" height=\"2516\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CleanShot-2021-11-23-at-20.39.54@2x.png?resize=2714%2C2516&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-357702\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CleanShot-2021-11-23-at-20.39.54@2x.png?w=2714&amp;ssl=1 2714w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CleanShot-2021-11-23-at-20.39.54@2x.png?resize=300%2C278&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CleanShot-2021-11-23-at-20.39.54@2x.png?resize=1024%2C949&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CleanShot-2021-11-23-at-20.39.54@2x.png?resize=768%2C712&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CleanShot-2021-11-23-at-20.39.54@2x.png?resize=1536%2C1424&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CleanShot-2021-11-23-at-20.39.54@2x.png?resize=2048%2C1899&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CleanShot-2021-11-23-at-20.39.54@2x.png?resize=1000%2C927&amp;ssl=1 1000w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-gallery-block-is-just-gravy\">The Gallery Block is just gravy.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I like seeing this in there:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2842\" height=\"2164\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-23-at-8.49.52-PM.png?resize=2842%2C2164&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of a Cloudinary screen in the WordPress admin.

It shows that this plugin is part of <em>modern</em> WordPress. Block editor WordPress. The block itself is simple, but useful. It shows images in a variety of useful layouts with a &#8220;lightbox&#8221;-like effect (wow, it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve typed the word lightbox). Hey, sometimes you just need a dang image gallery and you might as well use one that is well done.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-who-am-i-to-say\">Who am I to say?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a lowly blogger, I suppose. But I can tell you I&#8217;ve been watching this evolve for quite a while. A ways back, I had implemented a hand-rolled Cloudinary integration here on CSS-Tricks because I wanted all this stuff. I ultimately had to give up on it as it was more technical debt than I could maintain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The previous versions of the WordPress plugin were better, but it&#8217;s not until now, v3, where this integration is truly nailed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after that time I tore down my custom integration, I blogged <a href=\"https://srv.buysellads.com/ads/long/x/TCSDGFI3TTTTTTFY4NKC4TTTTTT2QX67K6TTTTTTY4K7AYVTTTTTTASZZQZ662JM5QZ6ASII5EANPMPZ5JMD6SZ5KREE\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">&#8220;Workflow Considerations for Using an Image Management&nbsp;Service&#8221;</a> and outlined what I thought the (rather high) bar would be for integrating a third-party image host. It was a lot to ask, and I wasn&#8217;t really sure if anyone would find the incentive and motivation to do it all. Well, Cloudinary has done it here. This is as perfect a media management plugin as I could imagine.</p>\n"

Google favors websites with fast loading times and good website performance. As long as you know the best steps to follow, you can also rank higher in search results.</strong></p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world, everyone wants interactive websites with quick loading times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-ca/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/\">reports</a> mobile web pages load within 22 seconds on average. However, 53 percent of mobile users will leave a page that takes longer than three seconds to load.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These numbers prove that optimizing your site to maximize performance should be a top priority. As such, Google announced the creation of Core Web Vitals, which includes three metrics: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As of mid June 2021, this Google page experience update is a ranking factor in search engines.</p>\n<p>How can you make your website pass Google&#8217;s Core Web Vitals?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To start off, we&#8217;ll discuss the following topics in this article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What Google&#8217;s Core Web Vitals metrics are</li>\n<li>How to measure Core Web Vitals</li>\n<li>What a good score for Google&#8217;s Core Web Vitals is</li>\n<li>How to improve your score for Core Web Vitals</li>\n<li>Tools to improve Core Web Vitals</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whataregooglescorewebvitalsmetrics\">What are Google&#8217;s Core Web Vitals Metrics?</h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the main thing you need to know about the Core Web Vitals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</strong>. This is a Core Web Vital that measures the amount of time it takes to render the main content or the largest content element visible on the page.</li>\n<li><strong>First Input Display (FID)</strong>. This measures how quickly a page responds to a user&#8217;s actions.</li>\n<li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</strong>. This measures the unexpected movement of content when viewing a page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a more in-depth, deep dive, you can check out our <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/core-web-vitals/\">guide on the Core Web Vitals</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtomeasurecorewebvitalsmetrics\">How to measure Core Web Vitals Metrics?</h2>\n<p>Measuring Core Web Vitals is fast and easy with Google PageSpeed Insights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just place the URL of your entire site in the text box, click the <strong>Analyze</strong> button and let the tool do the rest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635928800pagespeed-insights.jpg\" alt=\"Google PageSpeed Insights\" /></p>\n<p>The Core Web Vitals can be found under the <strong>Field Data</strong> and <strong>Lab Data</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635928795lcp.jpg\" alt=\"Google's Core Web Vitals\" /></p>\n<p>Field Data refers to historical reports about a web page&#8217;s performance based on anonymized reports from Chrome users. Meanwhile, Lab Data uses a simulated load page with specific network conditions to rate a site.</p>\n<p>Google PageSpeed Insights uses a slower network connection for the lab test to account for users with slow internet speed.</p>\n<p>In the example pictured above, the field LCP data is 1.7 seconds, while the lab LCP is 3.4 seconds. Meanwhile, the FID is 19ms, while the Cumulative Layout Shift is 0.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisagoodscoreforgooglescorewebvitals\">What Is a Good Score for Google&#8217;s Core Web Vitals?</h2>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s look at the scores you should aim for to pass the Chrome User Experience Report. Let&#8217;s break it down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LCP</strong>: a good LCP score is around <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520?hl=en\">2.5 seconds</a> or less. Websites that load within 2.6 to 4 seconds need improvement, while those with a load time greater than four seconds have a poor LCP.</li>\n<li><strong>FID</strong>: a good threshold for the FID score would require a delay of less than 100ms. However, surpassing 300ms denotes a bad user experience.</li>\n<li><strong>CLS</strong>: a CLS score below 0.1 is considered good, but anything above 0.25 is considered poor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Optimizing your website seems like a challenge, especially if your landing page has a lot of elements. The good news is that it&#8217;s possible — as long as you apply the following best practices for improving your score for Google&#8217;s Core Web Vitals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"specifictechniquesforimprovinglargestcontentfulpaint\">Specific Techniques for Improving Largest Contentful Paint</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some popular tactics to improve your LCP score.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id=\"imagecompression\">Image compression</h3>\n<p>Image compression involves minimizing or grouping parts of an image file so that it takes up less space. Despite the reduction in image size, this process doesn&#8217;t significantly impact the overall quality of an image in most cases.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The best image compression tools include <a href=\"https://ezgif.com/optipng\">Ezgif</a>, <a href=\"http://jpeg-optimizer.com/\">Jpeg Optimizer</a>, <a href=\"https://tinypng.com/\">Tiny PNG</a>, and <a href=\"https://compressor.io/\">Compressor</a>. Utilizing image formats like JPEG and WebP also lets images get rendered faster.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id=\"utilizeacontentdeliverynetworkcdn\">Utilize a content delivery network (CDN)</h3>\n<p>A CDN can reduce the distance between the user and the server, which leads to a faster page load time and better LCP.

If you have Node.js installed, then you&#8217;ll have npm installed.</p>\n<p>To check if Node is installed, run the following in the command line:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">node -v\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should be able to see the version. Do the same for npm:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm -v\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>It should be noted that Tailwind CSS <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrading-to-v2#upgrade-to-node-js-12-13-or-higher\">requires</a> Node.js version 12.13.0 or higher.</p>\n<p>If you get an error for either, then you have to install Node. You can follow the installation instructions on the Node <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">website</a>, or you can follow along with our article “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Installing Multiple Versions of Node.js Using nvm</a>”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"settingupreactandtailwindcss\">Setting Up React and Tailwind CSS</h2>\n<p><em>Note: if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with Create React App, check out “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/create-react-app/\">Create React App: Get React Projects Ready Fast</a>” first.</em></p>\n<p>First, create a React project with <code>create-react-app</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx create-react-app react-shop\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, change directory to the created project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd react-shop\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we&#8217;ll install the dependencies required for Tailwind CSS:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re installing Tailwind CSS with the PostCSS 7 compatibility build, as Create React App (or CRA) <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app#install-tailwind-via-npm\">does not support PostCSS 8</a> at the time of writing this article. We&#8217;re also installing <code>autoprefixer</code>, as it&#8217;s required for Tailwind CSS <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrading-to-v2#install-tailwind-css-v2-0-and-post-css-8\">after version 2.0</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"settingupcraco\">Setting Up CRACO</h2>\n<p>Usually, to configure CRA you need to run <code>react-scripts eject</code> or <code>npm run eject</code> with the default scripts of CRA. However, this is very inconvenient, as it will eject all the configurations that are hidden in CRA (like webpack configurations, Babel configurations, PostCSS configurations, and much more) into your project, and editing it can become a hassle or produce issues that CRA will no longer be able to support.</p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco\">Create React App Configuration Override (or CRACO)</a> comes in. CRACO is a library that adds a simple configuration layer to CRA. Instead of ejecting all the configurations inside CRA into your project — for example, just to add some configuration to Webpack — all new configurations or changes to the original configuration will be put in a new file <code>craco.config.js</code>. CRACO allows you to configure CRA to get the best out of it without the hassle.</p>\n<p>We need CRACO here to override PostCSS configurations and add the <code>tailwindcss</code> plugin. So, let&#8217;s first install it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install @craco/craco\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>When using CRA, the scripts in <code>package.json</code> look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"scripts\": {\r\n  \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\r\n  \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\r\n  \"test\": \"react-scripts test\",\r\n  \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>As we&#8217;re using CRACO to do what we can&#8217;t do with CRA by default, we need to change the scripts to use CRACO for building the project or running it in development:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"scripts\": {\r\n  \"start\": \"craco start\",\r\n  \"build\": \"craco build\",\r\n  \"test\": \"craco test\",\r\n  \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"\r\n},\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>We&#8217;ve replaced <code>react-scripts</code> with <code>craco</code> in the <code>start</code>, <code>build</code> and <code>test</code> scripts. We haven&#8217;t make any changes to the <code>eject</code> script.</p>\n<p>Next, create the CRACO configuration file <code>craco.config.js</code> in the root of the project:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">module.exports = {\r\n  style: {\r\n    postcss: {\r\n      plugins: [\r\n        require('tailwindcss'),\r\n        require('autoprefixer'),\r\n      ],\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This configuration file adds the <code>tailwindcss</code> and <code>autoprefixer</code> plugins to <code>postcss</code>.</p>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ll generate the configuration file for Tailwind CSS:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx tailwindcss init\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: if you&#8217;re using Node.js v14, there&#8217;s a reported issue about an error thrown while running this command that says &#8220;Cannot find module &#8216;autoprefixer'&#8221;. Updating to Node.js v15 should work, but if you&#8217;re unable to do that, please follow one of the workarounds <a href=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/2831\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This will create the file <code>tailwind.config.js</code> in the root of the project. It will have the following content:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">module.exports = {\r\n  purge: [],\r\n  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'\r\n  theme: {\r\n    extend: {},\r\n  },\r\n  variants: {\r\n    extend: {},\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [],\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what each of the configuration keys means:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>purge</code>: this is used to specify the files Tailwind CSS should scan and see which Tailwind CSS classes are being used, so that it can remove all unused styles and classes in production.</li>\n<li><code>darkMode</code>: this specifies the behavior of dark mode in your project. The value can be <code>media</code> — meaning that the dark mode styling will be applied based on the dark mode <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme\">media query</a>, which depends on the default mode for the user&#8217;s OS. It can also be <code>class</code>, which means that the dark mode styling will be applied when a parent element in the HTML document has the <code>dark</code> class.</li>\n<li><code>theme</code>: this can be used to modify the color palette of the theme, fonts, breakpoints, and more. We&#8217;ll see how to make changes to the theme later in the tutorial.</li>\n<li><code>variants</code>: this allows you to apply additional variants to the core plugins of Tailwind CSS. We&#8217;ll see how it works later on in the tutorial.</li>\n<li><code>plugins</code>: a section to add plugins that can add extra utility classes, custom variants, base styles or more.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For now, we&#8217;ll just make two changes. First, we&#8217;ll change the <code>purge</code> key:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">purge: [\"./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\", \"./public/index.html\"],\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This tells Tailwind CSS to look through all <code>js</code>, <code>jsx</code>, <code>ts</code> and <code>tsx</code> files in the <code>src</code> directory, and the <code>public/index.html</code> file to figure out which classes will be used from Tailwind CSS and remove any unused classes.</p>\n<p>The second change will be for dark mode:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">darkMode: \"media\", // or false or 'class'\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>For the sake of simplicity in this tutorial, we&#8217;ll keep dark mode just based on the user&#8217;s OS preference.</p>\n<p>The final step in setting up our React project with Tailwind CSS is to include some of the Tailwind CSS styles in <code>src/index.css</code>. Replace the contents of this file with the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">@tailwind base;\r\n@tailwind components;\r\n@tailwind utilities;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>@tailwind</code> directive basically imports the styles into <code>index.css</code>. And by default, CRA imports <code>src/index.css</code> in <code>src/index.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import './index.css';\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This means that Tailwind CSS styles will be applied in our React project, and we&#8217;re ready to start building a beautiful website!</p>\n<h2 id=\"understandingtailwindcssutilitiesandvariants\">Understanding Tailwind CSS Utilities and Variants</h2>\n<p>Before getting into the coding, let&#8217;s understand what Tailwind CSS utility classes and variants are. Tailwind CSS is designed to make styling components easier and help you focus on making reusable components. Utility classes are a wide range of classes that allow you to style your component in any way you can think of without writing any CSS.</p>\n<p>For example, to style a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with a border, change font size, change background and text color, you&#8217;ll need to write something like this with CSS:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">div {\r\n  border: 1px solid #f00;\r\n  font-size: 15px;\r\n  background-color: #ff007f;\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using Tailwind CSS, you can do it just using the utility classes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;div class=\"border border-red-100 text-lg bg-red-400 text-white\"&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what each class means in this example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>border</code>: sets border width to 1px</li>\n<li><code>border-red-100</code>: sets border color to a shade of red (based on the theme)</li>\n<li><code>text-lg</code>: gives font size <code>1.125rem</code> and line height <code>1.75rem</code></li>\n<li><code>bg-red-400</code>: sets background color to a shade of red (based on the theme)</li>\n<li><code>text-white</code>: sets text color to white</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are many other classes you can use, with many different shades of colors as well, which makes theming easier. Using the utility classes, you rarely need to actually write any CSS at all.</p>\n<p>Okay, but what about media queries? What about psuedo classes? What about dark mode? Can these be done without having to write any CSS yourself?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when variants come in. <strong>Variants</strong> allow you to add styling to elements based on device breakpoints, states of elements, or whether dark mode is enabled or not.</p>\n<p>So, previously you might have done this to change the width of an element based on the size of the device:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">div {\r\n  width: 50%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) and (min-width: 768px) {\r\n  div {\r\n    width: 80%;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media screen and (max-width: 767px){\r\n  div {\r\n    width: 100%\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>With Tailwind CSS, it can be simply done as this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;div class=\"w-full md:w-3/4 lg:w-1/2\"&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This applies the <code>w-1/2</code> class (which means <code>width: 50%</code>) when <code>min-width: 1025px</code> applies to the current screen width, applies <code>w-3/4</code> class (which means <code>width: 80%</code>) when <code>min-width: 768px</code> applies to the current screen width, and applies <code>w-full</code> class (which means <code>width: 100%;</code>) when the other variants don&#8217;t apply anymore.</p>\n<p>This definitely makes the tedious work you have to do in every project easier and faster. At first, it might look confusing, but when you start dabbling in it more you&#8217;ll realize how it becomes second nature to use the utility classes and variants.</p>\n<p>You can read more about configuring Tailwind in the <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs\">project&#8217;s official documentation</a>.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-tailwind-css-build-site/?utm_source=rss\">Build a Website with React and Tailwind CSS</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

In this article, we&#8217;ll take a comprehensive look at 3xx status codes, so that you can understand how they work, how best to manage them, and their impact on SEO.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"thepurposeofhttpredirects\">The Purpose of HTTP Redirects</h2>\n<p>A URL redirect involves one web page address being mapped to another. There&#8217;s a range of reasons why redirecting is required for your site.</p>\n<p>For example, moving to a new domain is one of the overriding causes to use URL redirection. Sometimes your former domain name is too long and complicated to remember, or some kinds of infringing activities force you to move from one domain to another.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at other reasons to redirect your page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forwarding multiple domains</strong>: permanent HTTP redirects are required to lead internet users and search engines to the same location while having many domain names at once.</li>\n<li><strong>Identification of broken links</strong>: 404 not found pages can be identified with the Google Search Console. The Coverage report will give you detailed information about all the on-site inbound links to fix with the help of redirecting.</li>\n<li><strong>Fixing broken URLs</strong>: after identifying the broken link, you can redirect traffic to the front page. However, a better option is redirecting every broken URL to a new page with the same (similar) content.</li>\n<li><strong>The page’s new location</strong>: if your former website has highly visited pages that are ranked high in SERPs, redirecting will help you map this URL to the new location. For this case, you must be sure that the old pages you used for redirection haven&#8217;t disappeared.</li>\n<li><strong>The need to delete a page</strong>: create HTTP redirects for all the pages you need to delete and be sure not to dread and stress out visitors with 404 not found errors. Redirecting will signal to Google or other search engines that the link value of the old links should be assigned to the redirected URLs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Besides the main reasons listed above, there are some other cases to take into consideration. Redirecting will come in handy if you need to simplify and track display ads or cope with emergencies. Redirects help marketers with monitoring advertising responses. At the same time, web admins can fix any failed linking activity (error-driven notifications, mail chains) with the help of redirection.</p>\n<p>To sum up, Google defines redirecting to control crawling and indexing (category of the Advanced SEO Documentation). <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/301-redirects\">Google Search Central</a> explains HTTP redirects as the practice of performing a seamless transition, accessing a page through several URLs, correction of outdated URLs, and sending users from deleted pages to new ones, thereby excluding 404 not found errors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"webprotocolbasics\">Web Protocol Basics</h2>\n<p>The fundamental protocol on the Internet that&#8217;s used for transferring data and information control in hosting servers is called HTTP. The HyperText Transfer Protocol allows maintaining websites and providing communication between internet users and servers on the World Wide Web.</p>\n<p>HTTP is the protocol used for information systems with different types of data: distributed, hypermedia, and collaborative. The main goal of the HyperText Transfer Protocol is to provide seamless internet-based interactions. HTTP defines modifications, and data transfer provides a web server and browser actions.</p>\n<p>This request–response protocol works through TCP connections that are used for server communications. The Transmission Control Protocol allows internet searchers to interact with any available identified resources represented on the World Wide Web. User communication with web, video, and message servers takes place via HTTP. This way, clients can get access to web pages.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the HyperText Transfer Protocol uses proxies. They are special-purpose filters for content identification and analysis. HTTP proxies prevent users from low-quality sending and displaying files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>spyware text and imagery</li>\n<li>malformed multimedia files</li>\n<li>cyberattack-driven sound and video files</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are modes of the HTTP proxy operation. HTTP-Client is used for the protection of the user’s browser. It sends request messages to the server. An HTTP-Server is responsible for HTTP response connections. The principle of the HTTP proxy operation can be figured the following way:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1633995208http-proxy-op.png\" alt=\"HTTP proxy operation\" /></p>\n<p>The main benefits of the HTTP protocols are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Request responsibility</strong>: the advanced scheme of addressing is provided by HTTP protocols. All the IP addresses become easy to recognize and identify on the WWW.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved interactions with web resources</strong>: flexibility and accessibility of online resources are achieved. HTTP provides the opportunity for extension and plugin downloads. This way, relevant data is displayed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hitechwhizz.com/2020/08/5-advantages-and-disadvantages-drawbacks-benefits-of-http.html\">Hitech Whizz</a>, there are other advantages of the HyperText Transfer Protocol to take into account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security</strong>: interception is minimized, so data transfer takes place in a risk-free mode for users.</li>\n<li><strong>Page caching</strong>: if the user visited the internet resource once before, the content available on the page will be loaded faster.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced latency</strong>: HTTP initiates the handshaking process right after the connection is made. This option reduces connection-driven latency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HTTP is also notable for its web protocol-specific methods. They vary from one task to another. There are nine request methods to perform different web operations.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Protocol-specific Request</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>PUT</td>\n<td>Responsible for the modification of the existing web resource. This request also allows the creation of the new URL.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HEAD</td>\n<td>Creates a request for a special-purpose resource without any need for the body content.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>POST</td>\n<td>Responsible for the existing resource modifications in content adding to the new web page.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DELETE</td>\n<td>Deletes the resource specified by the webmaster.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GET</td>\n<td>Requests the resource about its integrity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TRACE</td>\n<td>Displays any updates and changes of the web recourse visited by the user.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OPTIONS</td>\n<td>Demonstrates the list of HTTP methods that are accessible for the URL of the user’s interest.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CONNECT</td>\n<td>Responsible for the conversion of the request-based connection to the TCP/IP tunnel.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PATCH</td>\n<td>Makes it possible to undertake partial modifications of the web resource.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"whatarehttpresponsestatuscodes\">What Are HTTP Response Status Codes?</h2>\n<p>HTTP status codes are special elements that determine the server response and are presented as 3-rigid coherent symbols. Each HyperText Transfer Protocol code is used for REST API errors. It&#8217;s necessary to understand each HTTP status code to identify problems and solve them.</p>\n<p>There are five classes of the status codes to take into consideration. There are informational response, successful, redirection, client error, and serve error categories. The first rigid indicates the class of the HTTP status code. Let’s take a closer look at each category of the responses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1xx informational response</strong>: this class of status codes informs about request reception. It means that the process continues. For example, <em>100 = continue</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>2xx successful</strong>: the group of these status codes is about understanding and acceptance of the request. For example, <em>200 = OK</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>3xx redirection</strong>: this class of HTTP status codes indicates that some special-purpose actions are required to complete the request. For example, <em>301 = redirection</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>4xx client error</strong>: this category of response status codes flags that the request cannot be carried out. Additionally, it might mean that there is bad syntax in the request. <em>400 = bad request.</em></li>\n<li><strong>5xx server error</strong>: this class of HTTP status codes is about an unsuccessful server response caused by the server’s failed processing. For example, <em>500 = internal error</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that some of the status codes and errors have a direct impact on SEO. While 1xx and 2xx classes don&#8217;t affect search engine optimization much (while having a 200 response is the best practice), 300-, 400-, and 500-level ones can negatively impact crawling and indexing your web pages. You should always take care to address 4xx and 5xx status codes and errors, as this can be very harmful to your website’s ranking as a whole.</p>\n<p>HTTP 300 codes perhaps play the central role for SEO. This class of status codes is responsible for passing all the SEO value from your old URLs to new ones. Thus, it&#8217;s necessary to dig into each 300-level code&#8217;s meaning (temporary or permanent redirects, proxies, multiple choices, and so on).</p>\n<h2 id=\"thecompletelistof3xxhttpstatuscodes\">The Complete List of 3xx HTTP Status Codes</h2>\n<p>HTTP status codes are for URL redirection. The 300-level codes indicate different types of HTTP redirects. Marketers usually use 3xx status codes to monitor and analyze user experience, the behavior of website users, and the SEO performance of the site. The <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6\">DataTracker</a> resource identifies four types of redirects distributed by 300-level HTTP status codes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Redirections like <strong>301, 302, 307</strong> indicate that the target resource has been assigned a new URL.</li>\n<li><strong>300</strong> redirection offers multiple choices (selection of matching web resources according to the request).</li>\n<li><strong>303</strong> redirection offers an indirect response to the fulfilled request if the Location field identifies it.</li>\n<li><strong>304</strong> redirection provides HTTP redirects to the results that were cached upfront.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>300-level status codes appear when it is necessary to indicate the redirection response from the server. Another example of the 3xx HTTP status code class in action is when the deleted page keeps its rankings. Additionally, redirects come in handy when it&#8217;s necessary to fix the broken URL.</p>\n<p>For example, a 301 redirection was used via PHP to move all the traffic to a new page, <code>https://eurovps.com</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">&lt;?php // Permanent 301 Redirect via PHP\r\n\r\nheader(\"HTTP1.1 301 Moved Permanently\");\r\n\r\nheader(\"Location: https://eurovps.com/\");\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This way, it preserves the ranking of the former URL. The same algorithm can be used for fixing broken URLs with the help of a permanent redirect.</p>\n<p>Redirections don&#8217;t expect to see when errors related to other response codes take place. For example, redirects don&#8217;t solve problems with informational responses or server/client errors (<em>Not Implemented</em> = 501; <em>Bad Gateway</em> = 502; <em>Unprocessable Entity</em> = 420).</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at each 300-level code to understand their impact on SEO and website ranking. There are nine 3xx status codes to review, along with their peculiarities, functions, benefits, and differences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"300multiplechoices\">300 Multiple Choices</h3>\n<p>These status codes are commonly used in REST APIs. Multiple choices are given to the browser that should pick sides with the resources that meet the request. For example, if you have multiple video format options or different file extensions to specify, a 300-level code will come in handy.</p>\n<p>One more reason for using 300 redirects is to meet the requirements of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation#Agent-driven\">agent-driven negotiations</a>. The server informs a user-agent about available representation types to choose from. Take a closer look at the example to see the 300-redirect in action:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">HTTP/1.1 300 Multiple Choices\r\nServer: curveball/0.3.1\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,User-Agent\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\nLink: &lt;/foo&gt; rel=\"alternate\"\r\nLink: &lt;/bar&gt; rel=\"alternate\"\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nLocation: /foo\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see <code>/foo</code> and <code>/bar</code> in the coding. The location is specified when both options are accessible for choosing.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/3xx-http-status-codes-ultimate-guide/?utm_source=rss\">The Ultimate Guide to 3xx HTTP Status Codes</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Even though Shopify’s blogging features are somewhat basic, and there are other online services that specifically help bloggers to set up blogs that readers can subscribe to for a fee (such as Ghost), I’ll explain why you might rather use Shopify.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"huhshopifyforcontentwhy\">Huh? Shopify for content? Why?</h2>\n<p>Shopify is arguably leading the ecommerce space. It has the most customers and the highest number of (well-executed) out-of-the-box <a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/intro-to-shopify/pricing-plans/plan-features/\">features</a> compared to its rivals.</p>\n<p>Shopify can facilitate the sale of almost anything, including subscription-based services, digital downloads, free swag, and even in-store items thanks to its point-of-sale system.</p>\n<p>I would say that most believe Shopify to be number one at ecommerce, and while there are specialized services for selling access to content, I still believe Shopify is the better option.</p>\n<p>Let’s compare Shopify with <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a>, for example, since Ghost is the fastest-growing blogging CMS today.</p>\n<p>Shopify Basic and Ghost Pro Basic are both $29/month. However, Shopify can sell anything, whereas Ghost can only sell access to <em>subscription</em>-based content. Ghost can’t sell access to content for a one-time fee, or anything else on the side. Shopify wins hands down when it comes to business-model flexibility.</p>\n<p>Honestly, the only caveat is that the blogging features are considered to be Shopify’s weak link, but if you enjoy building themes from scratch (which frankly comes with <em>many</em> benefits), then you’d be surprised at how mighty and flexible Shopify’s Liquid template language is. I wouldn’t consider Shopify an ecommerce <em>platform</em>, but rather a CMS with roots in ecommerce.</p>\n<p>So, if you’d like to leave a new venture open to additional/alternative business models or you already have a Shopify store with a blog that you’d like to monetize, let’s kick things off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>You’ll need to be reasonably skilled in web development, understanding HTML and CSS, at least. Some knowledge of the Liquid template language that Shopify uses would certainly be beneficial, but not required, since Liquid is somewhat easy to learn along the way. (I’d recommend checking out the <a href=\"https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/\">Liquid documentation</a> regardless.)</p>\n<p>You’ll also need to <a href=\"https://shopify.com/\">create a Shopify account</a>, which is free for 14 days (no card required). Please note, however, that unless you pick a payment plan, you won&#8217;t be able to remove the password protection on your store.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step1definethethemestructure\">Step 1: Define the Theme Structure</h2>\n<p>First, let’s define the file structure of the theme using a mixture of required and common files. We won’t use all of them in this tutorial, but you can use this structure to kickstart any barebones Shopify store in the future.

Within the Shopify admin, navigate to <strong>Online Store</strong> &gt; <strong>Themes</strong> &gt; <strong>Actions</strong>  &gt; <strong>Edit code</strong> and then make note of the numeric theme ID in the URL. If you already have a theme set up, use <em>that</em> theme ID instead.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/162549785201.jpg\" alt=\"Obtain the Shopify theme ID\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/162549785402.jpg\" alt=\"Grab the Shopify theme ID from the URL\" /></p>\n<p><em>Note: while the default theme — “Debut” — is a fully-functioning coded theme, we’ll be overwriting it with our code.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"step3setupthemekit\">Step 3: Set up Theme Kit</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://shopify.dev/tools/theme-kit/\">Theme Kit</a> is a command-line tool for building and managing Shopify themes. In this tutorial, we’ll use Theme Kit to watch for code changes within our theme directory and deploy those changes to our theme.</p>\n<p>Theme Kit works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and works with workflow tools such as Git and Node.js. To keep things fairly simple, we’ll omit workflow tools and just use Theme Kit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installthemekit\">Install Theme Kit</h3>\n<p>First, install Theme Kit using the command line.</p>\n<h4 id=\"windowsandchocolately\">Windows and Chocolately</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">choco install themekit\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"macosandhomebrew\">macOS and Homebrew</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">brew tap shopify/shopify\r\nbrew install themekit\r\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"linux\">Linux</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">curl -s https://shopify.dev/themekit.py | sudo python\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"createashopifyapp\">Create a Shopify &#8220;app&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Next, create a Shopify &#8220;app&#8221; to acquire the necessary credentials that Theme Kit requires in order to authenticate theme changes.</p>\n<p>Within the Shopify admin, navigate to <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage private apps</strong>, then tick the three checkboxes to accept the terms and conditions. Next select <strong>Enable private app development</strong> &gt; <strong>Create private app</strong> and complete the form. </p>\n<p>In this step, you&#8217;ll need to give your private app a name and enter an emergency developer email. You&#8217;ll also need to enable “Read and write” access for “Themes” before clicking on the <strong>Save</strong> button.

It allows developers to easily use beautiful styles and components and create responsive websites. Using Bootstrap can save developers time, especially with components that are used in almost every project.</strong></p>\n<p>Bootstrap 5 (the current major version, released in May 2021) has brought with it tons of changes and improvements, including the addition of new components, new classes, new styling for old components, updated browser support, the removal of some old components, and much more.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll cover what has changed in Bootstrap 5, what has been dropped, and, most excitingly, what&#8217;s new.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whentousebootstrapandwhennot\">When to Use Bootstrap (and when not)</h2>\n<p>Bootstrap bills itself as &#8220;the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites&#8221;, and with 152k stars on GitHub, I don&#8217;t think that claim is too far-fetched. Especially for beginners, Bootstrap is a great way to start creating modern and clean websites. It makes it easy to realize complicated, mobile-first designs and provides many components that you&#8217;ll likely need across multiple projects.</p>\n<p>Bootstrap has a low learning curve and lends itself well to static websites that don&#8217;t require a build step, as you can just reference the library from Bootstrap&#8217;s CDN. This is in contrast to some other popular CSS frameworks that might be optimized for use with a bundler or task runner.</p>\n<p>You should also be aware, however, that Bootstrap <em>isn&#8217;t</em> a silver bullet. For the uninitiated, Bootstrap makes it easy to produce messy and convoluted markup. It&#8217;s also a relatively heavy library in terms of kilobytes (although this is improving with each release), so it might not be the best choice if you&#8217;re only using one or two of its features. As with any abstraction, it will help enormously if you have a good grasp of the underlying technology and can make an informed decision on when to use it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgradingfrombootstrap4to5\">Upgrading from Bootstrap 4 to 5</h2>\n<p>Upgrading from Bootstrap 4 to 5 is generally pretty easy. Most of the components, their classes and utility classes that were available in Bootstrap 4 are still available in Bootstrap 5. The main thing you should focus on when migrating is whether or not the classes or components you&#8217;re using <a href=\"#whats-dropped\">have been dropped</a>. If they&#8217;ve been dropped, there are replacements or ways to achieve the same result using utility classes. The second thing you should focus on is switching from <code>data-*</code> attributes to <code>data-bs-*</code> in components that require JavaScript as a part of their functionalities. (We&#8217;ll cover this more in the next section.)</p>\n<p>If you use Bootstrap&#8217;s Sass files, there are some variables and mixins that have been renamed. Bootstrap 5 has an extensive and detailed section all about <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/overview/\">customization</a>, as well as details about the Sass variables and mixins for each component in their respective documentation pages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatschanged\">What&#8217;s Changed</h2>\n<p>Bootstrap 5 brings core changes to Bootstrap as a library, with a change in required dependencies, browser support and more. It also brings changes to the components and classes that we&#8217;ve always used in previous versions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jquerynolongeradependency\">jQuery no longer a dependency</h3>\n<p>As a major change from the previous versions, jQuery is no longer a dependency of Bootstrap. Now, you can use Bootstrap in its full glory without it, but you still need Popper.js. This change makes it easier to use Bootstrap in projects that don&#8217;t require or use jQuery — such as when using Bootstrap with React.</p>\n<p>You can still use jQuery with Bootstrap if it&#8217;s a part of your website. If Bootstrap detects jQuery in the <code>window</code> object, it will automatically add all components to jQuery&#8217;s plugin system. So, if you&#8217;re migrating from v4 to v5, you don&#8217;t need to worry about this change, and you can still use jQuery with Bootstrap as necessary.</p>\n<p>But what if you use jQuery in your website, but you don&#8217;t want Bootstrap to use jQuery? You can do that by adding the attribute <code>data-bs-no-jquery</code> to the body element of the document:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;body data-bs-no-jquery=\"true\"&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>How does Bootstrap work without jQuery? For example, in v4 you would use the following code in JavaScript to create a <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/toasts\">Toast</a> element:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">$('.toast').toast()\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In Bootstrap 5, you can use that same code to create a Toast element if your website already uses jQuery. Without jQuery, you&#8217;ll need to use something like the following code to create a Toast element:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const toastElList = [...document.querySelectorAll('.toast')]\r\nconst toastList = toastElList.map((toastEl) =&gt; {\r\n  return new bootstrap.Toast(toastEl)\r\n})\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This just uses Vanilla JavaScript to query the document for elements having a <code>.toast</code> class, then initializes a Toast component on the element using <code>new bootstrap.Toast()</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"browsersupportchange\">Browser support change</h3>\n<p>Up until v4, Bootstrap used to support Internet Explorer (IE) 10 and 11. As of Bootstrap 5, support for IE has been fully dropped. So, if you need to support IE in your website, you probably should be careful when migrating to v5.</p>\n<p>Other changes in browser support include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox and Chrome support now starting from version 60</li>\n<li>Safari and iOS support now starting from version 12</li>\n<li>Android Browser and WebView support now starting from version 6</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"changeindataattributes\">Change in data attributes</h3>\n<p>Bootstrap 5 has changed the naming of the data attributes that are generally used by its components that use JavaScript as part of their functionality. Previously, most components that relied on some JavaScript functionalities would have data attributes starting with <code>data-</code>. For example, to create a Tooltip component in Bootstrap 4:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;button \r\n  type=\"button\" \r\n  class=\"btn btn-secondary\" \r\n  data-toggle=\"tooltip\" \r\n  data-placement=\"top\" \r\n  title=\"Tooltip\"\r\n&gt;\r\n  Tooltip\r\n&lt;/button&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice the usage of <code>data-toggle</code> and <code>data-placement</code>. In Bootstrap 5, data attributes for these components now start with <code>data-bs</code> to easily namespace Bootstrap attributes. For example, to create a Tooltip component in Bootstrap 5:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;button \r\n  type=\"button\" \r\n  class=\"btn btn-secondary\" \r\n  data-bs-toggle=\"tooltip\" \r\n  data-bs-placement=\"top\" \r\n  title=\"Tooltip\"\r\n&gt;\r\n  Tooltip\r\n&lt;/button&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead of using <code>data-toggle</code> and <code>data-placement</code>, we use <code>data-bs-toggle</code> and <code>data-bs-placement</code>. If you use JavaScript to create components in Bootstrap, there&#8217;s probably no need to make any changes. However, if your components rely only on data attributes to function, you need to change all data attributes that start with <code>data</code> to start with <code>data-bs</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bugsfixed\">Bugs fixed</h3>\n<p>In Bootstrap 4&#8217;s documentation under <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/browsers-devices/\">Browsers and devices</a>, there&#8217;s a list of bugs that occur on some browsers. These bugs are no longer listed in <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/browsers-devices/\">the same list</a> for Bootstrap 5. The list includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hover styling was being applied to elements on touch events on iOS, which wasn&#8217;t desirable as it was considered as an unexpected behavior.</li>\n<li>Using <code>.container</code> in Safari 8 and above caused a small font size on printing.</li>\n<li>Border radius was being overridden by validation feedback (but could be fixed by adding an extra <code>.has-validation</code> class).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The list of bugs and issues in Bootstrap 4&#8217;s documentation also details bugs that happened on browser versions that are no longer supported.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/bootstrap-5-new-features-examples/?utm_source=rss\">What’s New in Bootstrap 5</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

There may be people who know far more than you, but there are always more who are yet to acquire the skills you currently possess. And only a small percentage of those who know as much as you or more can efficiently document that expertise or pass it on to others.</strong></p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll discuss how you can take advantage of your engineering know-how to build your reputation, help others, and improve your financial security.</p>\n<p>Most people&#8217;s first teaching experience is writing &hellip;</p>\n<h2 id=\"writeforyourself\">Write for Yourself</h2>\n<p>The first rule of write club is <em>always write for yourself</em>.</p>\n<p>Forget dreams of fame and fortune and write what you&#8217;re passionate about. Choose topics you know such as problems you solved during real projects. Your brain will fool you into thinking you&#8217;ll remember the tools and techniques forever. It&#8217;s lying. Your collection of posts will become a personal knowledge repository. I still Google my own articles to discover how I tackled problems — <em>often only a few weeks after writing them</em>.</p>\n<p>Writing for yourself has benefits, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Punctuality prevails over perfection. You&#8217;re less likely to procrastinate because it&#8217;s more important to document a process while it&#8217;s fresh in your memory.</li>\n<li>You won&#8217;t worry about perception. It&#8217;s your personal notes; whether it&#8217;s useful to others is irrelevant.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ll have fewer inhibitions. There&#8217;s no need to sweat over research, content duplication, keyword analysis, well good grammar, or other secondary priorities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Write regularly — <em>and make it public</em>.</p>\n<p>Consider private posts when they contain references to intellectual property or personal information. This is rare in software engineering: you&#8217;ll generally be documenting an implementation approach or known API with your own experiences.</p>\n<p>A personal blog created with a <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/static-site-generators/\">static site generator</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-with-eleventy/\">Eleventy</a> is ideal. Content can be written in Markdown files, backed up in a Git repository, transformed to various formats, and hosted for free using services such as <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>, or <a href=\"https://vercel.com/\">Vercel</a>.</p>\n<p>Content management systems such as WordPress offer a more immediate publishing process and features such as search. The downside is that posts are stored in a database which can be more difficult to back up, and switching to another system is a burden (although <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wordpress-headless-cms-eleventy/\">there are options</a>).</p>\n<p>You can post to social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Medium. These provide further publicity, but you&#8217;ll lose control of your content and surrender some rights. Always ensure you have adequate copies.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, use whatever tool makes you productive. It&#8217;s more important to write frequently than dither over the choice of publishing medium.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shareyourcontent\">Share Your Content</h2>\n<p>Your content may be niche, or it may solve an obscure edge problem, but it will always have a target audience. A single post could help thousands of developers.</p>\n<p>The most immediate candidates are your colleagues and clients. At some point, someone will ask for your help and you&#8217;ll be able to direct them your URLs. If that post doesn&#8217;t exist, you have a new topic for consideration.</p>\n<p>Others will recognize your potential before you. Your reputation will increase and you may be asked to contribute further documentation, conduct peer reviews, or train colleagues. Engineers often avoid these tasks, so tackling the work will raise your profile and career prospects further.</p>\n<p>From your perspective, you&#8217;re still writing for yourself. The process will make you a better developer. <em>Teaching others expands your knowledge and exposes the gaps</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"postpolishing\">Post Polishing</h2>\n<p>Others may be thrilled by your work, but your most important critic is you.</p>\n<p><em>Do you enjoy writing?</em></p>\n<p>Few engineers are able to create good technical posts. Others may be capable writers but lack the inclination. Either could make money from writing but they&#8217;re unlikely to persevere over the long term.</p>\n<p>A small set of developers posses the passion and motivation to write about a subject. You may fall into this group if you can list half a dozen post titles you&#8217;d like to write.</p>\n<p>The next step is to write more focused and polished posts. First, pick your subject (or subjects). This seems obvious but you&#8217;re moving beyond a personal blog. No one will stop you posting about JavaScript, pancake recipes, and honey badger photography, but releasing it on the same site will confuse readers and search engines. Create separate channels for each subject as necessary.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve not done so already, purchase an appropriate domain — perhaps using your own name or your subject — and create a website. Design is important, but you can change it at any time. <em>Content matters more</em>. Many web industry celebrities have dreadful sites and it hasn&#8217;t held them back. <em>(Maybe be careful, though, if you&#8217;re writing about web design!)</em></p>\n<p>Each post should have a single idea, objective, or purpose. Have a clear goal: <em>what do you want the reader to learn?</em></p>\n<p>Simple, highly focused posts often resonate better with readers. For example: <em>How to Use Async/Await in JavaScript</em> can appeal to more people than the vaguer <em>Getting Started with Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript</em>. Both would cover the same topics, but <em>Async/Await</em> solves an immediate problem. (<em>Asynchronous Programming</em> may work better as a <a href=\"#booksandvideocourses\">book</a>).</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re explaining a development topic, <em>demonstration code is essential</em>. Write the code before tackling the post. It&#8217;s often more difficult than the article, and it may change the way you approach the topic.</p>\n<p>Example client-side code can be embedded directly into your post using tools such as <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a> or <a href=\"https://jsfiddle.net/\">JSFiddle</a>. Server-side demonstrations are more difficult, but consoles are available for most languages including <a href=\"https://glitch.com/\">Node.js</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mycompiler.io/new/deno\">Deno</a>, <a href=\"https://www.writephponline.com/\">PHP</a>, <a href=\"https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/\">Python</a>, <a href=\"https://play.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a>, <a href=\"http://sqlfiddle.com/\">SQL</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_basic_online.php\">Qbasic</a>. At the very least, push your code to a public repository and add screenshots or expected output where appropriate.</p>\n<p>Every word counts, so be concise. Start the post by summarizing what the reader will learn, then get to the point. Word count metrics are vanity statistics, <em>(although publications still use them to rank or approve articles)</em>.</p>\n<p>Technical posts should work through solutions in a methodical manner. Explain each step in detail and be careful not to make unjustified presumptions about the reader&#8217;s level of knowledge. For example, if you&#8217;re explaining how to connect to an SQL database in Node.js, the reader will need to have some experience of those technologies. You shouldn&#8217;t need to explain how to open a terminal or install the runtime, but a quick overview describing how to initialize a project and add any necessary modules is essential. Avoid claiming a step is &#8220;simple&#8221;; <em>that may not be the case for some readers!</em></p>\n<p>Find your own voice, be friendly, and be welcoming, but be wary of humor and sarcasm. They don&#8217;t always translate well to a global audience, and you risk offending some readers. A flippant remark can escalate and become the focal point of your post.</p>\n<p>Above all, <em>continue to write for yourself</em>. Post frequently and don&#8217;t worry about perfection or view counts. Your articles are unlikely to make financial gains, but they&#8217;ll prove your abilities and accomplishments.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/teaching-side-hustle-engineers/?utm_source=rss\">Teaching as a Side Hustle for Engineers</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

They&#8217;re becoming more and more popular as interest levels in these tools have steadily increased.</p>\n<p>Webflow is one of the more popular <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://webflow.com/\">online no-code tools</a>. It helps you design and build websites without knowing languages like CSS or having to write custom JavaScript code, while still giving you the ability to create stunning websites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"webdesignfornoncoders\">Web Design for Non-coders</h2>\n<p>Tools like Webflow are great for non-coders like the general public and for those in the creative field who want more control over their sites without spending tons of time learning coding languages first (for example, graphic designers who are wanting to get into web design).</p>\n<p>Webflow seems to have positioned itself in a way that caters to the general public all the way up to experienced web designers and developers who already know how to code, but looking for solutions to help them be better and more efficient.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636583368webflow-home.png\" alt=\"Webflow Home Page\" /></p>\n<p>Webflow does most (if not all) of the heavy lifting for you when it comes to developing your website. Designed with a user interface (UI) — called the Designer — that feels more like a design what-you-see-is-what-you-get app, it writes the code for you in the background as you start laying out your elements and customizing your styles. Webflow has free templates to help you get started (which is great for novice users and those who don’t feel their design skills are any better than the templates), but you can also start from scratch if you’re a more experienced user or know your way around front-end coding languages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"webflowasavisualwebdesigntool\">Webflow as a Visual Web Design Tool</h2>\n<p>With Webflow, there’s likely two different types of users that would regularly use Webflow: those who don’t have the know-how to code their own site and need the assistance that Webflow and its visual editor provides, and those who can design and code their own websites and are looking to speed up/simplify the process.</p>\n<p>For those who need assistance in developing their own website, Webflow helps you along the way with templates and tutorials to do most of the coding work for you. However, you’ll likely learn that you’ll want to start picking up some coding skills in order to truly customize things to your liking and to fully understand the breadth of features that Webflow offers.</p>\n<p>For web designers/developers who are experienced at developing their own sites, Webflow can get out of your way and allow you to get straight to work inside their visual designer. However, with some of their features limited, you&#8217;ll likely run into things quickly that you can’t do that you wish you could, and likely will find yourself diving into the code at some point along the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h2>\n<p>Webflow does come at a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://webflow.com/pricing\">monthly price</a>, depending on how you want to use the platform. You can pay monthly per site, or monthly for an individual account with multiple projects. While not clear from the start, these two pricing plans cater to the two different types of users discussed above.</p>\n<p>For those who own their site and want just one or two sites, the site plan is likely where you’ll want to be. For those who are web designers/developers who plan to use Webflow as a tool to develop sites to hand over to clients, the account plans are likely the better fit (especially if you’d like to download your site from Webflow and use it elsewhere, such as on your own server or with CMSs such as WordPress).</p>\n<p>Either way, you get a free-forever plan that allows you experiment and work with Webflow to get your site where you want it to be before you decide to upgrade. (However, the free-forever plan limits what you can and can&#8217;t do. For example, you can&#8217;t connect your site to a custom domain.)</p>\n<p>Webflow&#8217;s pricing is great for those who just need one or two sites. However, it could get quite expensive for someone who&#8217;d like to have several websites at once. Somewhat tied to the pricing is another drawback (perhaps more so a drawback for the more experienced users): being able to design then export your site to then use/modify for another platform (such as WordPress) isn’t the most ideal, and requires you to pay monthly for the ability as well, even if you opt to not launch/host your site on Webflow.</p>\n<p>Overall, Webflow’s popularity means that people are reaping the benefits from the no-code tool, and it continues to draw the attention of not only the general public, but those who are fairly novice with web development all the way up to those who are experienced web designers and developers.</p>\n<p>Since you’ve likely landed on this article because you too are interested in Webflow and how it can be beneficial for your situation, let’s dive in to how to get started with Webflow to get you familiar with the platform and how you might utilize it for your needs. We&#8217;ll then end with information about the best path to take should you continue on your Webflow journey.</p>\n<h2 id=\"skilllevel\">Skill Level</h2>\n<p>Even though Webflow is billed as a “no-code” tool, it should be stated that it doesn’t mean “no-skill”. Webflow has a bit of a learning curve to understand, even for the seasoned web developer. Those who don’t have much of a background in web design/development may find this learning curve more steep than they were hoping for when trying out a tool billed as “no-code”. Having some basic understanding of websites (such as layouts and the box model) and how to style things (such as margins, paddings, floats, positions, etc.) is beneficial and reduces the learning curve, but isn&#8217;t essential for using Webflow.</p>\n<p>While I would say that Webflow is easy to pick up and learn (which is a biased opinion, as I’ve coded dozens of websites in my career), be prepared for some time learning the ropes and understanding not only how Webflow works, but web design and development principles as well. Those who have experience building websites will likely fare better through the initial learning curve than those new to building websites in no-code tools.</p>\n<p>The great thing, however, is that Webflow understands this and has spent significant time creating what they call “Webflow University” to help you learn their tools and develop your web design and development skills on their platform. It’s also a great resource beyond what this getting started guide will cover, should you want to take your Webflow experiment/skill set to the next level.</p>\n<h2 id=\"signupandonboarding\">Sign Up and Onboarding</h2>\n<p>Signing up for an account with Webflow is as easy as it is on most other sites you’ve created accounts with. Clicking “Get Started” at the top of the home page will walk you through the signup and onboarding process. The onboarding process will help you set your account up correctly by asking questions to get to know more about you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636583628webflow-signup.png\" alt=\"Webflow Signup Screen\" /></p>\n<p>Once you’ve gone through the onboarding questionnaire, you’ll be dropped into the Webflow visual editor, called the Designer, to start a tutorial. Regardless of how experienced you are with web development, I highly recommend you spend the time to go through the tutorial, as it will help reduce the learning curve as you move on to your first project.</p>\n<p>Some of the most important parts of the tutorial that Webflow walks you through are the Elements Panel, classes, how to make your site responsive with breakpoints, and ending with information about how to push your project live. It’s during the tutorial where you’re likely to get a good understanding of the skills needed, especially as it explains different web principles to you (like cascading style sheets).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636583709webflow-tutorial.png\" alt=\"Webflow Tutorial During Onboarding\" /></p>\n<p>Once you’ve completed the quick welcome tutorial, it’s time to start your first project (as prompted when you’ve completed the introductory topics). Clicking <strong>Create New Project</strong> puts you right into Webflow’s visual editor.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636583775webflow-createnewproject.png\" alt=\"Webflow Create New Project\" /></p>\n<p>From here, it’s a “choose your own adventure” type of setup on what path you want to move forward with. For the sake of learning and understanding how Webflow works, I highly recommend picking a template to edit instead of jumping straight into a blank site project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636583836webflow-templates.png\" alt=\"Webflow Templates\" /></p>\n<p>For this how-to tutorial, we’re going to edit an existing Webflow template to learn how the Designer works and the major features of the main interface you’ll be using inside Webflow.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/webflow-absolute-beginners-guide/?utm_source=rss\">An Absolute Beginner’s Guide to Webflow</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

This is definitely worth doing, and there are many starting points online to help you build your own HTML5 template.</strong></p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll look at how to get started with building your own HTML5 boilerplate. We&#8217;ll walk through the essential elements of an HTML template, ending with a basic template that you can take with you and build upon. </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d rather just grab the code now and read this article later, <a href=\"#thecompletehtml5boilerplate\"><strong>here&#8217;s our finished HTML5 template</strong></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theanatomyofanhtml5template\">The Anatomy of an HTML5 Template</h2>\n<p>An HTML template typically includes the following parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#thehtml5doctype\">The document type declaration</a> (or doctype)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#thehtmlelement\">The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> Element</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#htmldocumentcharacterencoding\">The character encoding</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#theviewportmetaelement\">The viewport meta element</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#thetitledescriptionandauthor\"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>description</code>, and <code>author</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#opengraphmetaelementsforsocialcards\">Open Graph meta elements for social cards</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#faviconsandtouchicons\">Favicons and touch icons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#includingastylesheetandscripts\">Links to stylesheets and scripts</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other than the document type declaration and <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, the elements listed above will mostly be found inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the HTML template.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thehtml5doctype\">The HTML5 Doctype</h2>\n<p>Your HTML5 template needs to start with a document type declaration, or <em>doctype</em>. A doctype is simply a way to tell the browser — or any other parser — what type of document it&#8217;s looking at. In the case of HTML files, it means the specific version and flavor of HTML. The doctype should always be the first item at the top of any HTML file. Many years ago, the doctype declaration was an ugly and hard-to-remember mess, often specified as &#8220;XHTML Strict&#8221; or &#8220;HTML Transitional&#8221;.</p>\n<p>With the advent of HTML5, those indecipherable eyesores are gone and now all you need is this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;!doctype html&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Simple, and to the point. The doctype can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case. You’ll notice that the “5” is conspicuously missing from the declaration. Although the current iteration of web markup is known as “HTML5”, it really is just an evolution of previous HTML standards — and future specifications will simply be a development of what we have today. There&#8217;s never going to be an &#8220;HTML6&#8221;, so it&#8217;s common to refer to the current state of web markup as simply &#8220;HTML&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Because browsers are required to support older content on the Web, there’s no reliance on the doctype to tell browsers which features should be supported in a given document. In other words, the doctype alone isn&#8217;t going to make your pages compliant with modern HTML features. It&#8217;s really up to the browser to determine feature support on a case-by-case basis, regardless of the doctype used. In fact, you can use one of the older doctypes with new HTML5 elements on a page and the page will render the same as it would if you used the new doctype.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thehtmlelement\">The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> Element</h2>\n<p>Following the doctype in any HTML document is the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This hasn&#8217;t undergone any significant change since the advent of HTML5. In the code snippet above, we’ve included the <code>lang</code> attribute with a value of <code>en</code>, which specifies that the document is in English. This isn&#8217;t required for a page to validate, but you&#8217;ll get a warning from most validators if you don&#8217;t include it.</p>\n<p>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element is divided into two parts, the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> sections. The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section contains important information about the document that isn&#8217;t displayed to the end user — such as the <a href=\"#htmldocumentcharacterencoding\">character encoding</a>, and <a href=\"#includingastylesheetandscripts\">links to CSS files and possibly JavaScript</a>. The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section contains everything that&#8217;s displayed in the browser — text, images, and so on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"htmldocumentcharacterencoding\">HTML Document Character Encoding</h2>\n<p>The first line inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of an HTML document is the one that defines the character encoding for the document. This is an optional feature and won&#8217;t cause any warnings in validators, but it&#8217;s recommended for most HTML pages:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In nearly all cases, <code>utf-8</code> is the value you’ll be using in your documents. A full explanation of character encoding is beyond the scope of this article, and it probably won’t be that interesting to you, either. Nonetheless, if you want to delve a little deeper, you can <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#encoding-terminology\">read about character encoding in the HTML specification</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: to ensure that certain older browsers read the character encoding correctly, the entire character encoding declaration must be included somewhere within the first 512 characters of your document. It should also appear before any content-based elements (like the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element that appears later in our example)</em>.</p>\n<p>There’s much more we could write about this subject, but for now, we’re content to accept this simplified declaration and move on to the next part of our document.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theviewportmetaelement\">The Viewport Meta Element</h2>\n<p>The viewport meta element is a feature you&#8217;ll see in just about every HTML5 template. It&#8217;s important for responsive web design and mobile-first design:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element includes two attributes that work together as a name/value set. In this case, the <code>name</code> is set to <code>viwport</code> and the value is <code>width=device-width, initial-scale=1</code>. This is used by mobile devices only. You&#8217;ll notice the value has two parts to it, described here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>width=device-width</code>: the pixel width of the viewport that you want the website to be rendered at.</li>\n<li><code>initial-scale</code>: this should be a positive number between 0.0 and 10.0. A value of &#8220;1&#8221; indicates that there&#8217;s a 1:1 ratio between the device width and the viewport size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can read up a little more on these meta element features <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name#standard_metadata_names_defined_in_other_specifications\">on MDN</a>, but for now just know that, in most cases, this meta element with these settings is best for mobile-first, responsive websites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thetitledescriptionandauthor\">The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>description</code>, and <code>author</code></h2>\n<p>The next section of the HTML template contains the following three lines:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;title&gt;A Basic HTML5 Template&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"A simple HTML5 Template for new projects.\"&gt;\r\n&lt;meta name=\"author\" content=\"SitePoint\"&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>These elements have been part of HTML for a long time, so there&#8217;s nothing too new here. The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is what&#8217;s displayed in the browser&#8217;s title bar (such as when you hover over a browser tab). This element is the only mandatory element inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>The other two are optional <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> elements defining a description for SEO purposes along with an author. All elements inside <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> are optional with the exception of <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. In fact, you can put <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-meta-element\">as many valid <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> elements</a> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> as you like.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/?utm_source=rss\">HTML5 Template: A Basic Boilerplate for Any Project</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

            "\n<p>I’d like to tell you something&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to do to make your website better.&nbsp;<strong>Don’t add any</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/third-party-scripts/\"><strong>third-party scripts</strong></a>&nbsp;<strong>to your site</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That may sound extreme, but at one time it would’ve been common sense. On today’s modern web it sounds like advice from a tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy nut. But just because I’m paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get your user’s data.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-356844\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>All I’m asking is that we treat third-party scripts like third-party cookies. They were a mistake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Browsers are now beginning to block third-party cookies. Chrome is dragging its heels because the same company that makes the browser also runs an advertising business. But even they can’t resist the tide. Third-party cookies are used almost exclusively for tracking. That was never the plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the beginning, there was no state on the web. A client requested a resource from a server. The server responded. Then they both promptly forgot about it. That made it hard to build shopping carts or log-ins. That’s why we got cookies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In hindsight, cookies should’ve been limited to a same-origin policy from day one. That would’ve solved the problems of authentication and commerce without opening up a huge security hole that has been exploited to track people as they moved from one website to another. The web went from having no state to having too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that vulnerability is finally being closed. But only for cookies. I would love it if third-party JavaScript got the same treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"ticss-5d1c923a\">When you add&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;third-party file to your website—an image, a stylesheet, a font—it’s a potential vector for tracking. But third-party JavaScript files go one further. They can execute arbitrary code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just take a minute to consider the implications of that: any third-party script on your site is allowing someone else to execute code on your web pages. That’s astonishingly unsafe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It gets better. One of the pieces of code that this invited intruder can execute is the ability to pull in&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;third-party scripts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think there’s no harm in adding that one little analytics script. Or that one little&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/915886339391918083\">Google Tag Manager snippet</a>. It’s such a small piece of code, after all. But in doing that, you’ve handed over your keys to a stranger. And now they’re welcoming in all their shady acquaintances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://requestmap.herokuapp.com/\">Request Map Generator</a>&nbsp;is a great tool for visualizing the resources being loaded on any web page. Try pasting in the URL of an interesting article from a news outlet or magazine that someone sent you recently. Then marvel at the sheer size and number of third-party scripts that sneak in via one tiny&nbsp;<code>script</code>&nbsp;element on the original page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why I recommend that the one thing people can do to make their website better is to not add third-party scripts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easier said than done, right? Especially if you’re working on a site that currently relies on third-party tracking for its business model. But that exploitative business model won’t change unless people like us are willing to engage in a campaign of passive resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, I know. If you refuse to add that third-party script, your boss will probably say, “Fine, I’ll get someone else to do it. Also, you’re fired.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tactic will only work if everyone agrees to do what’s right. We need to have one another’s backs. We need to support one another. The way people support one another in the workplace is through a union.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think I’d like to change my answer to the question that’s been posed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing people can do to make their website better is to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ueunion.org/org_steps.html\">unionize</a>.</p>\n"

The key(s) are important, hence the need to store/protect the key(s) arises. Creating an environment variable that stores the key is the “go-to” solution that most developers tend to embrace, but there’s a catch. The environment variable <strong>does not protect the key(s)</strong> from anyone that knows their way around the dev-tools of their browser. That’s why we need to use our keys at server-side when we’re writing our API calls.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll be using Next.js to bootstrap our app. This does not mean that the <a href=\"https://create-react-app.dev/\"><code>create-react-app</code></a> library will not work. You can make use of any one that you find convenient. We’re using Next.js because of the many perks that come with it. (You can read more about Next.js <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started.\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Let us start by installing the dependencies that we need in this project. We’ll start by creating a Next.js app. The command below does that for us:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npx create-next-app [name-of-your-app]</code></pre>\n\n<p>We’ll make use of the native JavaScript <code>&quot;Fetch API&quot;</code> library to get data from the API. We won’t be covering much of the styling aspect in this article. (If you want to take a look at an example project I built using the Next.js API route pattern, you can find the repository <a href=\"https://github.com/Caleb335/article-example-projects/blob/master/src/container/users/index.js\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Now let’s have a look at the file structure of the app. We’ll be focusing on the important files needed in this app, so it’ll be concise.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">|--pages\n|   |-- api\n|   |   |-- serverSideCall.js  \n|   |-- _app.js\n|   |-- index.js\n|__ .env.local</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"breakdown-of-the-files-in-the-app-structure\">Breakdown Of The Files In The App Structure</h2>\n\n<p>In this section, we are going to see the different files that make up the architecture of this project, and their respective functions below.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>pages</code> directory is where all the routing of the app takes place. This is an out-of-the-box feature of Next.js. It saves you the stress of hard hard-coding your independent routes.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>pages/api</code><br />\nThe api directory enables you to have a backend for your Next.js app, inside the same codebase, instead of the common way of creating separate repositories for your REST or GraphQL APIs and deploying them on backend hosting platforms like Heroku, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>With the <code>api</code> directory, every file is treated as an API endpoint. If you look at the <code>api</code> folder, you’ll notice that we have a file called <code>user.js</code> in it.</p>\n\n<p>That file becomes an endpoint, which means an API call can be performed using the path to the file as the base URL.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const getData = async() =&gt; {\n  fetch(\"/api/users\")\n   .then(response =&gt; response())\n   .then(response =&gt; console.log(response.data))\n   .catch(err =&gt; console.log(err)\n}</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>pages/_app.js</code><br />\nIt is where all our components get attached to the DOM. If you take a look at the component structure, you’ll see that all the components are passed as <code>pageProps</code> to the <code>Component</code> props too.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    &lt;React.Fragment&gt;\n      &lt;Head&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=\"theme-color\" content=\"#73e2a7\" /&gt;\n        &lt;link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/ico\" href=\"\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/Head&gt;\n      &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;\n    &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;\n  );\n}\n\nexport default MyApp;</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you are new to Next.js, kindly go through this <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/getting-started-with-next-js/\">article</a> that will guide you through the process.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>index.js</code><br />\nIt is the default route in the pages folder. When you run the command below, it starts up a development server and the contents of <code>index.js</code> are rendered on the web page.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm run dev</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>.env.local</code><br />\nIt is where we’re storing the API key that’ll enable us to consume this API.\n\n<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div data-audience=\"non-subscriber\" data-remove=\"true\" class=\"feature-panel-container\"><span class=\"feature-panel__desc\">More after jump!

In this section, we will move on to how we can consume the API.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why we’re writing the API call at the server-side is for securing our API key, and Next.js already makes it an easy task for us. With the API routes in Next.js, we can perform our API calls without the fear of our API keys being revealed on the client-side.</p>\n\n<p>You may have been wondering what the essence of the environment variable in the <code>.env</code> file is, in this scenario.</p>\n\n<p>The environment variable (which is our API key) can only be available in <code>development</code> mode.</p>\n\n<p>That is why we can do something like <code>process.env.api_key</code>, and get access to the environment variable.</p>\n\n<p>But, the moment you deploy your app to platforms like Netlify or Vercel, the mode changes to <code>production</code>, which makes the Node.js <code>process</code> object unavailable on the client-side.</p>\n\n<p>Now that you have seen the reason why need to write a server-side API call. Let’s get to it right away.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default async function serverSideCall(req, res) {\n    const {\n      query: { firstName, lastName },\n    } = req;\n\n    const baseUrl = `https://api.example-product.com/v1/search?\n        lastName=${lastName}&firstName=${firstName}\n        &apiKey=${process.env.KEY}\n    `;\n    const response = await fetch (baseUrl);\n    res.status(200).json({\n    data: response.data,\n  });\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the snippet above, we created an asynchronous function called, <code>serverSideCall</code>. It takes in two arguments, <code>req</code> which stands for “request” in full, and <code>res</code> which is “response” in full.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>req</code> argument has some properties, (or “middlewares” as the Next.js docs call it) that can be accessed when we’re consuming our API, one of them is <code>req.query</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll notice that we destructured the <code>query</code> property in the snippet above, so we should now be able to pass those variables as values to the query properties of the API endpoint. Take a look at it below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>You can read more about the in-built middlewares that come with the <code>req</code> argument <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/api-middlewares\">here</a>.</em></p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const {\n  query: { firstName, lastName },\n} = req;</code></pre>\n\n<p>The base URL takes the destructured query properties as values and the <code>apiKey</code> is gotten from the <code>.env</code> file via the Node.js <code>process</code> object.</p>\n\n<p>The destructured query properties are taken as requests that will be sent from the input values of the form component (which we’ll be creating in the next section) to the API, once it is received, we get a response that corresponds with the request we made.</p>\n\n<div class=\"break-out\">\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const baseUrl = `https://api.kelvindata.com/rest/v1/searchv2?  lastName=${lastName}&firstName=${firstName}&apiKey=${process.env.KEY}`;</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>The next process the function has to complete is the response from the asynchronous API call. The snippet below assigns the API call which we are performing with the <code>axios</code> library to a variable, <code>response</code>.</p>\n\n<p>On the next line, the <code>res</code> argument uses the <code>status</code> method which is used to send a JSON response to us, then we can assign the response variable as a property of <code>data</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const response = await axios.get(baseUrl);\nres.status(200).json({\n  data: response.data,\n});</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can read more about the various HTTP status codes <a href=\"https://dillionmegida.com/p/http-status-codes/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"practical-usage-of-the-server-side-api-function\">Practical Usage Of The Server-Side API Function</h2>\n\n<p>In this section, we’ll have a look at how we can utilize the server-side API call by creating a form with two input fields. The input values will be sent as query parameters to the API endpoint.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">import React from \"react\";\n\nconst Index = () =&gt; {\n  const [data, setData] = React.useState([]);\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = React.useState(\"\");\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = React.useState(\"\");\n\n  const getuserData = async () =&gt; {\n    // api call goes here\n  };\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) =&gt; {\n     e.preventDefault();\n     getuserData();\n  };\n\n  return (\n     &lt;React.Fragment&gt;\n       &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;\n          &lt;label htmlFor=\"firstname\"&gt;First name&lt;/label&gt;\n          &lt;input\n            type=\"text\"\n            name=\"firstname\"\n            value={firstName}\n            placeholder=\"First Name\"\n            onChange={(e) =&gt; setFirstName(e.target.value)}\n          /&gt;\n          &lt;label htmlFor=\"lastname\"&gt;Lastname&lt;/label&gt;\n          &lt;input\n            type=\"text\"\n            name=\"lastname\"\n            value={lastName}\n            placeholder=\"Lastname\"\n            onChange={(e) =&gt; setLastName(e.target.value)}\n          /&gt;\n           &lt;button&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;/form&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"results-from-api\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;\n );\n};\n\nexport default Index;</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since this is a React component that is receiving data from an API endpoint, it should have an internal state of its own. The snippet below shows how we defined the different state variables with React Hooks.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const [userData, setUserData] = React.useState([]);\nconst [firstName, setFirstName] = React.useState(\"\");\nconst [lastName, setLastName] = React.useState(\"\");</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> variables will store the text values that are typed into the input field by anyone into the local state variables.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>data</code> state variable helps us store the response that we get from the API call in an array, so we can use the JavaScript <code>map()</code> method to render the response on the webpage.</p>\n\n<p>Below, we’re using <code>axios</code> to get data from the API endpoint. But here, the base URL is not a typical <code>https://</code> URL, instead, it is the path to the file where we made the server-side API call before.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const getuserData = async () =&gt; {\nfetch(`/api/usersfirstName=${firstName}&lastName=${lastName}`, {\n       headers: {\n         Accept: \"application/json\",\n       },\n})\n  .then((response) =&gt; response)\n  .then((response) =&gt; {\n    setData(response.data.data); \n    console.log(response.data.data);\n  })\n  .catch((err) =&gt; console.log(err));\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p>The same process in the <code>serverSideCall.js</code> file is repeated, but this time around with the necessary fetch API headers and assignment of the input state variables to the API query parameters.</p>\n\n<div class=\"sponsors__lead-place\"></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>There are other approaches that can help achieve this feat.

            "<p>For those who just got in touch with JavaScript might be confused when hearing people say that JavaScript is a single threaded and non-blocking programming language. You might be thinking how could one be single threaded but non-blocking? <br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>Single Threaded</strong><br>\n<br><br>\nJavaScript is known to be single threaded because of its property of having only one call stack, which some other programming languages have multiple. JavaScript functions are executed on the call stack, by LIFO (Last In First Out). For example we have a piece of code like this:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight javascript\"><code><span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">foo</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">bar</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">trace</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"nx\">bar</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>And the call stack will have foo to enter into call stack, then bar.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cdqp8Odv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/exvl0p4kqy36psxbjr00.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cdqp8Odv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/exvl0p4kqy36psxbjr00.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"496\" height=\"503\"></a></p>\n\n<p>After bar() is done, it will be popped off from the call stack, followed by foo(). You will see an anonymous function underneath when printing out the stack trace, and that is the global execution context of main thread.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZjxRxe7Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qfgz6mxfax3zebp2xjzx.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZjxRxe7Y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qfgz6mxfax3zebp2xjzx.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"203\" height=\"228\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This seems to be logical as JavaScript is a single threaded language and there is only a single flow to execute all these functions. However, in the case that we are having some unpredictable or heavy tasks in the flow (for example making an API call), we do not want them to block the execution of the remaining codes (else users might be staring at a frozen screen). This is where the asynchronous JavaScript comes in.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>Non-Blocking</strong><br>\n<br><br>\nOther than JavaScript Engine, we also have Web APIs, Callback Queue and Event Loop to form JavaScript runtime in the browser. Let's say we have a piece of code here:<br>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight javascript\"><code><span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">1</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">setTimeout</span><span class=\"p\">(()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">2</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"mi\">5000</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">3</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>\"setTimeout\" is a Web API function that will execute a callback function after a certain amount of time (in milliseconds, in this case is 5000 milliseconds). When you execute this script, you will see that \"1\" and \"3\" are printed out instantly, and \"2\" is printed out around 5 seconds later. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LTH44MmL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bkachgjqdjftob1gm07r.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LTH44MmL--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bkachgjqdjftob1gm07r.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"333\" height=\"154\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This is what happened behind the scene:</p>\n\n<p>The first console log is put into the stack, and popped off after printed out \"1\" in the console. When setTimeout function is put into the stack, the callback function is set to await by this Web API function. The setTimeout function is then popped off the stack and the third console log enters. After finished executing, the third console log and the current global execution context are popped off from stack. </p>\n\n<p>When the callback function in setTimeout finished awaiting, it will enter to Callback Queue (or event queue) and wait to be executed. Event loop facilitates and checks if the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new global execution context is created and this call back function (console log out \"2\") will then be put into the stack, executed and popped off. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MOs4GbAM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/guc8ykvjaahtv1045ws9.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MOs4GbAM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/guc8ykvjaahtv1045ws9.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"880\" height=\"495\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I hope this gives you an idea of why JavaScript can be single threaded and non-blocking at the same time. Thought of writing this as I just recently shared this with the new joiner to our company.</p>\n\n<p>Oh btw, if you still need a video explanation, here is a good resource:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ\">What the heck is the event loop anyway? | Philip Roberts | JSConf EU</a></p>\n\n<p><br><br>\n<strong>Do follow me for more future articles on web design, programming and self-improvement</strong> 😊</p>\n\n"

You’ll learn what they are and how to adopt them for your own web projects. A reasonable knowledge of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript is necessary.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarewebcomponents\">What are Web Components?</h2>\n<p>Ideally, your development project should use simple, independent modules. Each should have a clear single responsibility. The code is encapsulated: it&#8217;s only necessary to know what will be output given a set of input parameters. Other developers shouldn&#8217;t need to examine the implementation <em>(unless there&#8217;s a bug, of course).</em></p>\n<p>Most languages encourage use of modules and reusable code, but browser development requires a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render content, styles, and functionality. Related code can be split across multiple files and may conflict in unexpected ways.</p>\n<p>JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular have alleviated some of the headaches by introducing their own componentized methods. Related HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined into one file. Unfortunately:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it&#8217;s another thing to learn</li>\n<li>frameworks evolve and updates often incur code refactoring or even rewriting</li>\n<li>a component written in one framework won&#8217;t usually work in another, and</li>\n<li>frameworks can be heavy and limited by what is achievable in JavaScript</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A decade ago, many of the concepts introduced by jQuery were added to browsers (such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector\">querySelector</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/closest\">closest</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/classList\">classList</a>, and so on). Today, vendors are implementing web components that work natively in the browser without a framework.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s taken some time. <a href=\"https://fronteers.nl/congres/2011/sessions/web-components-and-model-driven-views-alex-russell\">Alex Russell made the initial proposal</a> in 2011. Google&#8217;s (polyfill) <a href=\"https://github.com/Polymer/polymer\">Polymer framework</a> arrived in 2013, but three years passed before native implementations appeared in Chrome and Safari. There were some fraught negotiations, but Firefox added support in 2018, followed by Edge (Chromium version) in 2020.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howdowebcomponentswork\">How do Web Components Work?</h2>\n<p>Consider the HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> elements, which allow users to play, pause, rewind, and fast-forward media using a series of internal buttons and controls. By default, the browser handles the layout, styling, and functionality.</p>\n<p>Web components allow you to add your own HTML <strong>custom elements</strong> — such as a <code>&lt;word-count&gt;</code> tag to count the number of words in the page. The element name must contain a hyphen (<code>-</code>) to guarantee it will never clash with an official HTML element.</p>\n<p>An ES2015 JavaScript class is then registered for your custom element. It can append DOM elements such as buttons, headings, paragraphs, etc. To ensure these can&#8217;t conflict with the rest of the page, you can attach them to an internal <strong>Shadow DOM</strong> that has it&#8217;s own scoped styles. You can think of it like a mini <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, although CSS properties such as fonts and colors are inherited through the cascade.</p>\n<p>Finally, you can append content to your Shadow DOM with reusable <strong>HTML templates</strong>, which offer some configuration via <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<p>Standard web components are rudimentary when compared with frameworks. They don&#8217;t include functionality such as data-binding and state management, but web components have some compelling advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they&#8217;re lightweight and fast</li>\n<li>they can implement functionality that&#8217;s impossible in JavaScript alone (such as the Shadow DOM)</li>\n<li>they work inside <em>any</em> JavaScript framework</li>\n<li>they&#8217;ll be supported for years — <em>if not decades</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"yourfirstwebcomponent\">Your First Web Component</h2>\n<p>To get started, add a <code>&lt;hello-world&gt;&lt;/hello-world&gt;</code> element to any web page. (The closing tag is essential: you can&#8217;t define a self-closing <code>&lt;hello-world /&gt;</code> tag.)</p>\n<p>Create a script file named <code>hello-world.js</code> and load it from the same HTML page (ES modules are automatically deferred, so it can be placed anywhere — but the earlier in the page, the better):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;script type=\"module\" src=\"./hello-world.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hello-world&gt;&lt;/hello-world&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Create a <code>HelloWorld</code> class in your script file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// &lt;hello-world&gt; Web Component\r\nclass HelloWorld extends HTMLElement {\r\n\r\n  connectedCallback() {\r\n    this.textContent = 'Hello, World!';\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Web components must extend the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement\">HTMLElement interface</a>, which implements the default properties and methods of every HTML element.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Firefox can extend specific elements such as <code>HTMLImageElement</code> and <code>HTMLButtonElement</code>. However, these don&#8217;t support the Shadow DOM, and this practice isn&#8217;t supported in other browsers.</em></p>\n<p>The browser runs the <code>connectedCallback()</code> method whenever the custom element is added to a document. In this case, it changes the inner text. <em>(A Shadow DOM isn&#8217;t used.)</em></p>\n<p>The class must be registered with your custom element in the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry\">CustomElementRegistry</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// register &lt;hello-world&gt; with the HelloWorld class\r\ncustomElements.define( 'hello-world', HelloWorld );\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Load the page and &#8220;Hello World&#8221; appears. The new element can be styled in CSS using a <code>hello-world { ... }</code> selector:</p>\n<p><!-- CODEPEN: https://codepen.io/craigbuckler/pen/WNpaxPN --></p>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"html,result\" data-slug-hash=\"ZEKyeoY\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n<span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/ZEKyeoY\"><br />\n&lt;hello-world&gt; component</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br />\non <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p><script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script></p>\n<h2 id=\"createawordcountcomponent\">Create a <code>&lt;word-count&gt;</code> Component</h2>\n<p>A <code>&lt;word-count&gt;</code> component is more sophisticated. This example can generate the number of words or the number of minutes to read the article. The <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-internationalization-api-i18n/\">Internationalization API</a> can be used to output numbers in the correct format.</p>\n<p>The following element attributes can be added:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>round=\"N\"</code>: rounds the number of words to the nearest N (default <code>10</code>)</li>\n<li><code>minutes</code>: shows reading minutes rather than a word count (default <code>false</code>)</li>\n<li><code>wpm=\"M\"</code>: the number of words a person can read per minute (default <code>200</code>)</li>\n<li><code>locale=\"L\"</code>: the locale, such as <code>en-US</code> or <code>fr-FR</code> (default from <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> <code>lang</code> attribute, or <code>en-US</code> when not available)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any number of <code>&lt;word-count&gt;</code> elements can be added to a page. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;p&gt;\r\n  This article has\r\n  &lt;word-count round=\"100\"&gt;&lt;/word-count&gt; words,\r\n  and takes\r\n  &lt;word-count minutes&gt;&lt;/word-count&gt; minutes to read.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"wordcountconstructor\">WordCount Constructor</h3>\n<p>A new <code>WordCount</code> class is created in a JavaScript module named <code>word-count.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">class WordCount extends HTMLElement {\r\n\r\n  // cached word count\r\n  static words = 0;\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n\r\n    super();\r\n\r\n    // defaults\r\n    this.locale = document.documentElement.getAttribute('lang') || 'en-US';\r\n    this.round = 10;\r\n    this.wpm = 200;\r\n    this.minutes = false;\r\n\r\n    // attach shadow DOM\r\n    this.shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });\r\n\r\n  }\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The static <code>words</code> property stores a count of the number of words in the page. This is calculated once and reused so other <code>&lt;word-count&gt;</code> elements don&#8217;t need to repeat the work.</p>\n<p>The <code>constructor()</code> function is run when each object is created. It must call the <code>super()</code> method to initialize the parent <code>HTMLElement</code> and can then set other defaults as necessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attachashadowdom\">Attach a Shadow DOM</h3>\n<p>The constructor also defines a Shadow DOM with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/attachShadow\"><code>attachShadow()</code></a> and stores a reference in the <code>shadow</code> property so it can be used at any time.</p>\n<p>The <code>mode</code> can be set to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>\"open\"</code>: JavaScript in the outer page can access the Shadow DOM using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/shadowRoot\">Element.shadowRoot</a>, or</li>\n<li><code>\"closed\"</code>: the Shadow DOM is inaccessible to the outer page</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This component appends plain text, and outside modifications aren&#8217;t critical. Using <code>open</code> is adequate so other JavaScript on the page can query the content. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const wordCount = document.querySelector('word-count').shadowRoot.textContent;\r\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"observingwordcountattributes\">Observing WordCount Attributes</h3>\n<p>Any number of attributes can be added to this Web Component, but it&#8217;s only concerned with the four listed above. A static <code>observedAttributes()</code> property returns an array of properties to observe:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">  // component attributes\r\n  static get observedAttributes() {\r\n    return ['locale', 'round', 'minutes', 'wpm'];\r\n  }\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>An <code>attributeChangedCallback()</code> method is invoked when any of these attributes is set in HTML or JavaScript&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute\"><code>.setAttribute()</code> method</a>. It&#8217;s passed the property name, the previous value, and new value:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">  // attribute change\r\n  attributeChangedCallback(property, oldValue, newValue) {\r\n\r\n    // update property\r\n    if (oldValue === newValue) return;\r\n    this[property] = newValue || 1;\r\n\r\n    // update existing\r\n    if (WordCount.words) this.updateCount();\r\n\r\n  }\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>this.updateCount();</code> call renders the component so it can be re-run if an attribute is changed after it&#8217;s displayed for the first time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wordcountrendering\">WordCount Rendering</h3>\n<p>The <code>connectedCallback()</code> method is invoked when the Web Component is appended to a Document Object Model. It should run any required rendering:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">  // connect component\r\n  connectedCallback() {\r\n    this.updateCount();\r\n  }\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Two other functions are available during the lifecycle of the Web Component, although they&#8217;re not necessary here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>disconnectedCallback()</code>: called when the Web Component is removed from a Document Object Model. It could clean up state, aborting Ajax requests, etc.</li>\n<li><code>adoptedCallback()</code>: called when a Web Component is moved from one document to another. <em>I&#8217;ve never found a use for it!</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>updateCount()</code> method calculates the word count if that&#8217;s not been done before. It uses the content of the first <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag or the page <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> when that&#8217;s not available:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">  // update count message\r\n  updateCount() {\r\n\r\n    if (!WordCount.words) {\r\n\r\n      // get root &lt;main&gt; or &lt;/body&gt;\r\n      let element = document.getElementsByTagName('main');\r\n      element = element.length ? element[0] : document.body;\r\n\r\n      // do word count\r\n      WordCount.words = element.textContent.trim().replace(/\\s+/g, ' ').split(' ').length;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>It then updates the Shadow DOM with the word count or minute count (if the <code>minutes</code> attribute is set):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">    // locale\r\n    const localeNum = new Intl.NumberFormat( this.locale );\r\n\r\n    // output word or minute count\r\n    this.shadow.textContent = localeNum.format(\r\n      this.minutes ?\r\n        Math.ceil( WordCount.words / this.wpm ) :\r\n        Math.ceil( WordCount.words / this.round ) * this.round\r\n    );\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n} // end of class\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Web Component class is then registered:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// register component\r\nwindow.customElements.define( 'word-count', WordCount );\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><!-- CODEPEN: https://codepen.io/craigbuckler/pen/XWMEQwd --></p>\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-default-tab=\"html,result\" data-slug-hash=\"rNmwyKx\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\">\n<span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/rNmwyKx\"><br />\n&lt;word-count&gt; component</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br />\non <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p><script async src=\"https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script></p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/frameworkless-web-components-introduction/?utm_source=rss\">An Introduction to Frameworkless Web Components</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Although it was created by Evan You (who also created Vue.js), it&#8217;s not framework-specific, so you can use Vite with Vue.js, React.js, Svelte.js, or even vanilla JavaScript.</strong></p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll expand upon the <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/vitejs-front-end-build-tool-introduction/\">overview</a> that was already published here and examine Vite&#8217;s source code to extract some insights about its internal architecture. In particular, we&#8217;ll explore Vite&#8217;s template and plugin systems. By the end, you&#8217;ll have a better understanding of the difference between templates and plugins, and how Vite&#8217;s core system is connected to a plugin.</p>\n<p>Now without further ado, let&#8217;s create an app with Vite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creatinganappwithvite\">Creating an App with Vite</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this demo, we&#8217;ll be creating a Vue project, using this command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm init vite@latest\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Having the <code>@latest</code> will make sure you always get the latest version whenever you do <code>npm install</code> inside this newly created project.)</p>\n<p>As a side note, you might have seen a deprecated version of the <code>init</code> command.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632214539img-1-deprecation.png\" alt=\"@vitejs/create-app is deprecated\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, the deprecation warning tells us to use <code>npm init vite</code> instead.</p>\n<p>This new command is basically a shorthand for:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx create-vite\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will install and run a tool called <code>create-vite</code>, which gives you prompts about what kind of project you&#8217;re creating. You&#8217;ll select a name and a template.</p>\n<p>Select a name you like for your project.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632214543img-2-select-name.png\" alt=\"Select a project name\" /></p>\n<p>And select a template to use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632214549img-3-select-template.png\" alt=\"Select a template\" /></p>\n<p>For exploration purposes, you can go with either <code>vanilla</code> or <code>vue</code>. </p>\n<p>Next, we&#8217;ll explore this <code>create-vite</code> tool through its source code on GitHub.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exploringthevitesourcecode\">Exploring the Vite Source Code</h2>\n<p>First, go to Vite&#8217;s GitHub page at <a href=\"https://github.com/vitejs/vite\">github.com/vitejs/vite</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632214555img-4-packages.png\" alt=\"Vite's GitHub repo\" /></p>\n<p>Then head inside the <code>packages</code> folder.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632214563img-6-create-vite.png\" alt=\"Inside the packages folder\" /></p>\n<p>Here, you can see <code>create-app</code> and <code>create-vite</code>. </p>\n<p><code>create-app</code> was responsible for the original command that says “deprecated”. What we&#8217;re interested in here is the <code>create-vite</code> folder. It hosts all the built-in templates for project creation.</p>\n<p>Inside the <code>packages</code> folder, we can also see some plugin folders for a few built-in plugins.</p>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s a good time to explore the differences between <em>templates</em> and <em>plugins</em>, and how they work together in the build tool workflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"templates\">Templates</h2>\n<p><em>Template</em> should be an easy concept to understand: it&#8217;s the starter code for a new project.</p>\n<p>Inside the <code>packages/create-vite</code> folder, you should see a dozen <code>template-*</code> folders.</p>\n<p>📁 <strong>/packages/create-vite</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632214559img-5-packages-folder.png\" alt=\"Inside the create-vite folder\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, Vite supports templates for various different frameworks (and their TypeScript counterparts).</p>\n<p>You can choose <code>vanilla</code> from the <code>create-vite</code> prompt.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632214567img-7-vanilla.png\" alt=\"Select a template\" /></p>\n<p>If you choose vanilla, it will basically take the files in the <code>packages/template-vanilla</code> folder and clone them as your new project.</p>\n<p>📁 <strong>/packages/template-vanilla</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632214571img-8-template-vanilla.png\" alt=\"Inside the template-vanilla folder\" /></p>\n<p>You can also choose <code>vue</code> from the prompt:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632214574img-9-vue.png\" alt=\"Select vue from the prompt\" /></p>\n<p>If you choose <code>vue</code>, it will clone the files in the <code>packages/template-vue</code> folder as your new project.</p>\n<p>📁 <strong>/packages/template-vue</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632214579img-10-template-vue.png\" alt=\"Inside the template-vue folder\" /></p>\n<p>The generated project from the vue template will feature the standard folder structure that you would expect from a Vue project.</p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s <em>template</em>. Now let&#8217;s talk about <em>plugin</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"plugins\">Plugins</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned, Vite isn&#8217;t framework-specific. It&#8217;s able to create projects for various frameworks because of its plugin system.</p>\n<p>Out of the box, Vite provides plugins for Vue, Vue with JSX, and React.</p>\n<p>You can examine the code for each built-in plugin in the <code>packages</code> folder:</p>\n<p>📁 <strong>/packages</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632215014img-11-plugins.png\" alt=\"Various plugins\" /></p>\n<p><em>Note: <code>plugin-legacy</code> is for legacy browsers that don&#8217;t support native ESM.</em></p>\n<p>The most common way that these plugins are used is through their corresponding templates. For example, the Vue template will require the use of the Vue plugin, and the React template will require the use of the React plugin.</p>\n<p>As the bare-bones option, a project created with the vanilla template has no idea how to serve Vue&#8217;s single-file component (SFC) files. But a Vue project created with Vite will be able to process the SFC file type. And it also knows how to bundle the entire Vue project for production.</p>\n<p>If we compare the respective <code>package.json</code> files from the Vue template and the vanilla template, we can easily see why that is.</p>\n<p>📁 <strong>/packages/template-vanilla/package.json</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632215017img-12-vanilla-package.png\" alt=\"Vanilla package.json\" /></p>\n<p>📁 <strong>/packages/template-vue/package.json</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632215020img-13-vue-package.png\" alt=\"Template-vue package.json\" /></p>\n<p><code>template-vue</code> contains everything that <code>template-vanilla</code> has, plus three additional packages.</p>\n<p>📁 <strong>/packages/template-vue/package.json</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"vue\": \"^3.2.6\" // 1\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@vitejs/plugin-vue\": \"^1.6.1\", // 2\r\n    \"@vue/compiler-sfc\": \"^3.2.6\", // 3\r\n    \"vite\": \"^2.5.4\"\r\n  }\r\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>vue</code> is the main library that runs during runtime</li>\n<li><code>@vitejs/plugin-vue</code> is the plugin that&#8217;s responsible for serving and bundling a Vue project</li>\n<li><code>@vue/compiler-sfc</code> is needed for compiling an SFC file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it&#8217;s safe to say that these three packages give a Vite project the ability to understand Vue code. The <code>@vitejs/plugin-vue</code> package is the &#8220;bridge&#8221; connecting Vite&#8217;s core system to the Vue.js framework.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/exploring-vite-source-code/?utm_source=rss\">Exploring Vite Through its Source Code</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

If not, please consult this <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_installing-a-supported-ssh-client\">list of supported clients</a>.</li>\n<li>An activated AWS account.

Here are some pros and cons of developing on the server.</p>\n<p>Firstly, the pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Portability</strong>: you can code from any device with internet access. Your code isn’t tied to your local machine, as such, you can code from anywhere using any device available at the moment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Power</strong>: you can easily scale up your remote server based on your workloads. It’s pretty straightforward to boot up a 32GB RAM <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/processors/amd-epyc-aws\">AMD EPYC</a> instance for some data science workloads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prod-Dev Synchrony</strong>: by having a remote dev environment similar to your production environment you can minimize any deployment issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Seamless Development</strong>: remote coding gives you the ability to create environments specially tailored to the project at hand. For example, a project might require different versions of MySQL, C++, and system libraries like LibPng and ImageMagick. Managing different versions of these might prove rather hectic, as any bugs that crop up because of this can&#8217;t be easily replicated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reliability</strong>: a cloud server is far more reliable than your local machine can ever be. Depending on your configurations, your server data can be replicated to servers in different parts of the world.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the cons. </p>\n<p>The main reason to avoid coding on a remote environment is the internet connection requirement to access your remote server. With a fast internet connection, the remote development experience feels native when opening, creating and typing in files, and interacting with the remote server&#8217;s command line. But with a slow 3G network, you might have disconnections to the server, which could potentially lead to lost work ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes. </p>\n<p>With that out of the way, let&#8217;s get to the meat of the article — setting up a free tier EC2 instance and connecting it to our local VS Code editor. </p>\n<h2 id=\"creatingandconfiguringtheawsserver\">Creating and Configuring the AWS server</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go through the steps for creating and configuring your cloud instance.</p>\n<p>Log into the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/console/\">AWS Management console</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16286115091.png\" alt=\"The AWS management console\" /></p>\n<p>Click <strong>EC2</strong> to head over to the EC2 dashboard.

Make sure the architecture is set to x86. We&#8217;ll be using the x86 architecture because it has the wider range of software support compared to ARM.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16286115333.png\" alt=\"AMI choosing page\" /></p>\n<p>Select <strong>t2.micro</strong> as the instance type.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16286115404.png\" alt=\"Instance type selection\" /></p>\n<p>Leave the rest of the steps on their default settings until you get to the <strong>add storage</strong> step. I recommend you use a minimum of 24GB. If you&#8217;re developing for Node.js, npm libraries take quite some space, and using less could put you in a difficult position, so it&#8217;s safer to err on the side of caution.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16286115185.png\" alt=\"Add storage EC2\" /></p>\n<p>Once you get to the <strong>Configure Security Group</strong> step, you’ll need to allow incoming SSH connections, you have two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enable all incoming IP addresses</strong>: selecting this will allow any IP address to access your SSH port, if your situation calls for convenience over security choose this.<br />\n<img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16286115146.png\" alt=\"Security group configuration\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>My IP</strong>: if security is more important, choose this option from the dropdown to restrict the IP address to yours only.<br />\n<img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16286115437.png\" alt=\"Own IP security group configuration\" /></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you click <strong>launch</strong>, you’ll be asked to either select or create an SSH key pair.

The Linux operating system offers a lot of privacy options, and it&#8217;s arguably the best OS to use if security and privacy is important to you.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"theprivacyproblem\">The Privacy Problem</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to stay anonymous online these days. Whether you&#8217;re browsing the Web or even using programs connected to the Internet, you&#8217;re being tracked. Even your operating system is watching you.</p>\n<p>By running an operating system like Windows, or a program like VS Code, you&#8217;re being tracked via telemetry. Most of the data that&#8217;s collected about you is used to improve the software you use every day, but if your priority is to stay anonymous, you should be looking for better options.</p>\n<p>Various distros of the Linux operating system offer features that enhance anonymity and privacy. But being anonymous can have drawbacks.</p>\n<p><em>Before I go on, a disclaimer of sorts. The aim of this article is to show what&#8217;s available for protecting your privacy. It&#8217;s not intended as an encouragement to engage in practices prohibited by your country&#8217;s laws.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesitmeantobeanonymous\">What Does It Mean to Be Anonymous?</h2>\n<p>Staying anonymous can mean different things to different people, so let&#8217;s clarify this concept before moving on.</p>\n<p>To stay anonymous online, you need to establish who you&#8217;re hiding from, and what tools will enable you to hide your real identity.</p>\n<p>You can use a threat modeling approach to identify the risks you might be exposed to. To put it simply, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has four steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>identify and characterize the system and data of interest</li>\n<li>identify and select the attack vectors to be included in the model</li>\n<li>characterize the security controls for mitigating the attack vectors</li>\n<li>analyze the threat model</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want to know more about threat modeling, follow the <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-154/draft/documents/sp800_154_draft.pdf\">NIST draft</a>, which includes detailed information about this process.</p>\n<p>For example, a journalist may want to stay anonymous while sharing their thoughts on the Web. This would cut out the fear of discrimination or retaliation. Simply put, they don&#8217;t want people to know who they are, so they know who they must hide from.</p>\n<p>Once you know who you want to stay anonymous from, it&#8217;s time to use tools like Tor or the anonymity-focused Linux distros shown next.</p>\n<p>Of course, anonymity has many advantages, but here are the main ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>freedom of speech: you can share your thoughts without the fear of being judged</li>\n<li>Less tracking: it&#8217;s more difficult to track what you&#8217;re doing online</li>\n<li>Personal safety: no one knows your real identity</li>\n<li>Data security: your data is precious, and staying anonymous makes it harder to steal it</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"variousmethodsforusingthefollowingdistros\">Various Methods for Using the Following Distros</h2>\n<p>In general, Linux-based operating systems are more secure and privacy-oriented than proprietary ones. Taking this into account, it&#8217;s important to know how the following distros work, and how they&#8217;ll help you stay anonymous.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usingvirtualmachines\">Using Virtual Machines</h3>\n<p>Virtual machines (VMs) are environments that work as a virtual computer that runs on top of your physical computer.</p>\n<p>VMs are isolated from the rest of the system, and they can be used to run almost any operating system, so they support the following Linux distros.</p>\n<p>The most popular software for running VMs is <a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/\">VirtualBox</a>, which is an open-source hypervisor created by Oracle. It works in Windows, Linux, and macOS, and is easy to set up.</p>\n<p>From a normal user perspective, the main advantage of using a VM is that you can run it along with your host operating system, which means you can use both at the same time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usingalivebootusb\">Using a Live Boot USB</h3>\n<p>A live USB runs an operating system without installing it on your computer. A live USB lets you jump into a live environment when you use it to install a Linux distro. A good example of this is the Parrot OS live environment, pictured below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631231976parrotos-live-env.jpg\" alt=\"Parrot OS live environment\" /></p>\n<p>The main advantage of this method is that you don&#8217;t need to install anything, so you can run the live USB on your computer, use the Linux distro, unplug the USB, and continue using your daily-driver OS.</p>\n<p>Take a look at Qubes for a total VM-based operating system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installingonbaremetal\">Installing on Bare Metal</h3>\n<p>If you want to stay anonymous, installing a Linux distro as the main OS on your system isn&#8217;t the best option, since you&#8217;ll be using your computer through multiple sessions.</p>\n<p>Each time you use your computer, you leave traces of information about the websites you&#8217;ve visited, files you opened, and even the Wi-Fi network you used.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why using a live boot USB, or a VM, is usually more secure.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re done with the live environment, shut it down and all the data will go away. Likewise with VMs, you can delete them once the job is done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beforejumpinginwhatstor\">Before Jumping In, What&#8217;s Tor?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a> — The Onion Router — is an open-source project that hides your IP address when browsing the Internet. It redirects your web request to a worldwide overlay network with over six thousand relays.</p>\n<p>When you use Tor, you&#8217;re routing all of your internet traffic through three machines selected from thousands of volunteer computers from different people and organizations.</p>\n<p>The first relay knows who are you, but not the next relay you&#8217;re going to connect to. The third relay only knows where you&#8217;re going (an external server, such as a web page) but not your original IP address.</p>\n<p>All of this occurs in an encrypted environment, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to avoid insecure pages — those without HTTPS.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1631234152tordiagram-htw3.png\" alt=\"Tor diagram\" /></p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://2019.www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en\">process</a> makes it almost impossible for anyone (websites, internet providers, and so on) to know your IP address.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatnottodowhenusingtor\">What not to do when using Tor</h3>\n<p>Tor lets you hide your IP address, but it becomes useless if you don&#8217;t use it properly. Here are a couple of things you <strong>shouldn&#8217;t</strong> do when using Tor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>authenticate using your cellphone</li>\n<li>use personal social accounts in Tor (Twitter, Facebook, Gmail)</li>\n<li>share personal information</li>\n<li>use an old Tor version</li>\n<li>use Google search; DuckDuckGo doesn&#8217;t collect user data</li>\n<li>browse any non-HTPPS (unencrypted) web pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve internalized these tips, you can use a shortcut made for the average user, the Tor browser bundle.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, you can download the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/\">Tor Browser</a> which is a browser that runs on top of Tor in all major operating systems. If you want, you can also download and compile <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/\">Tor source code</a>.</p>\n<p>But using Tor has some drawbacks. The most important one is that it limits your internet speed. This occurs because you&#8217;re routing your traffic through the Tor network, which means each web request you do has to pass by multiple computers.</p>\n<p>Another disadvantage is that some websites like Netflix, Bank sites, and so on, are blocked by Tor. Also, if you use Tor regularly, you&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/some-websites-turning-law-abiding-tor-users-into-second-class-citizens/\">fill in CAPTCHA forms in most pages you visit</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is a small price to pay for security and anonymity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tails\">Tails</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/\">Tails</a> is an anonymous Linux distribution based on Debian. It&#8217;s a lightweight and fast operating system which uses <a href=\"https://www.gnome.org/\">Gnome</a> as its default desktop environment.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630361765tails-gnome.png\" alt=\"Tails Gnome environment\" /></p>\n<p>It starts from a clean state and leaves no trace when you leave. That&#8217;s called “amnesia”, and it&#8217;s the magic that makes Tails a secure OS. You can use someone else&#8217;s computer securely because Tails doesn&#8217;t write to disk at any point.</p>\n<p>Another awesome thing about Tails is that it uses the Tor relay as the <strong>only</strong> way to access the Internet. That means that all the networking programs you use (programs that need to connect to the Internet) must redirect their traffic through a Tor network.</p>\n<p>So even if you&#8217;re using a simple app like Thunderbird, all the information it sends or retrieves from the Internet must pass through Tor.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1630360720tails-thunderbird.png\" alt=\"Using Thunderbird inside Tails\" /></p>\n<p>By default, Tails has installed the following apps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/\">Thunderbird</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download\">Tor Browser</a>, with Ublock Origin, and DuckDuckGo as the default search engine</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.libreoffice.org/\">Libre Office</a></li>\n<li>graphical editing apps like GIMP and Inkscape</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After using it for a while, it feels like a solid yet lightweight operating system, so you could run it on old computers. (It&#8217;s based on Debian 10)</p>\n<p>Also, I found this distro comes in handy when using a friends&#8217; computer, so you can keep both users&#8217; data safe.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tailsfeatures\">Tails Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tor relay for everything.</li>\n<li>Tails&#8217; storage isn&#8217;t persistent, so there&#8217;s no way to track you after you log out. However, you can enable an encrypted/persistent storage in case you need to install some other program or save some additional settings.</li>\n<li>It connects to the hardware of the computer but doesn&#8217;t interact with disk drives.</li>\n<li>In most cases, you can use it on virus-infected devices without any risk.</li>\n<li>It includes common-use apps, as well as <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/features/index.en.html\">encryption and privacy-focused software</a>.</li>\n<li>It allows you to install any package available in official Debian repositories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can access a more detailed list of features on <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/features/index.en.html\">Tails&#8217; official website</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tailsdownloadoptions\">Tails download options</h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to download Tails&#8217; USB stick version and install it on an 8Gb USB (or greater).</p>\n<p>If you want other options, Tails offers two ways of usage: via USB stick, and via virtualization (for use inside a VM).</p>\n<p>Here are the different installation images:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/install/download/index.en.html\">USB</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/install/vm-download/index.en.html\">Virtual machine ISO image</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: Running Tails in a VM has two problems. Your host OS and hypervisor can monitor what you&#8217;re doing in Tails, and Tails can leave traces on the hard disk, which is why it warns you when you&#8217;re using it in a VM.</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s up to you if you want to gain some degree of comfort (using Tails without restarting your PC) while losing a little bit of security.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/anonymous-linux-distros/?utm_source=rss\">The 4 Best Linux Distros for Helping You Stay Anonymous</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

The full program could then look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"rust language-rust\">use chrono::Utc;\r\n\r\nlet START_TIME = Utc::now().to_string();\r\n\r\npub fn main() {\r\n    let thread_1 = std::thread::spawn(||{\r\n        println!(\"Started {}, called thread 1 {}\", START_TIME.as_ref().unwrap(), Utc::now());\r\n    });\r\n    let thread_2 = std::thread::spawn(||{\r\n        println!(\"Started {}, called thread 2 {}\", START_TIME.as_ref().unwrap(), Utc::now());\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // Join threads and panic on error to show what went wrong\r\n    thread_1.join().unwrap();\r\n    thread_2.join().unwrap();\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Try it for yourself on the <a href=\"https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&#038;mode=debug&#038;edition=2018&#038;gist=51f73323b3d86ebbb1a89376d9235850\">playground</a>!</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"550px\" src=\"https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&#038;mode=debug&#038;edition=2018&#038;code=use%20chrono%3A%3AUtc%3B%0A%0Alet%20START_TIME%20%3D%20Utc%3A%3Anow().to_string()%3B%0A%0Apub%20fn%20main()%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20let%20thread_1%20%3D%20std%3A%3Athread%3A%3Aspawn(%7C%7C%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20println!(%22Started%20%7B%7D%2C%20called%20thread%201%20%7B%7D%22%2C%20START_TIME.as_ref().unwrap()%2C%20Utc%3A%3Anow())%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%7D)%3B%0A%20%20%20%20let%20thread_2%20%3D%20std%3A%3Athread%3A%3Aspawn(%7C%7C%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20println!(%22Started%20%7B%7D%2C%20called%20thread%202%20%7B%7D%22%2C%20START_TIME.as_ref().unwrap()%2C%20Utc%3A%3Anow())%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%7D)%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%0A%20%20%20%20%2F%2F%20Join%20threads%20and%20panic%20on%20error%20to%20show%20what%20went%20wrong%0A%20%20%20%20thread_1.join().unwrap()%3B%0A%20%20%20%20thread_2.join().unwrap()%3B%0A%7D\"></iframe></p>\n<p>This is invalid syntax for Rust. The <code>let</code> keyword can&#8217;t be used in the global scope. We can only use <code>static</code> or <code>const</code>. The latter declares a true constant, not a variable. Only <code>static</code> gives us a global variable.</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind this is that <code>let</code> allocates a variable on the stack, at runtime. Note that this remains true when allocating on the heap, as in <code>let t = Box::new();</code>. In the generated machine code, there is still a pointer into the heap which gets stored on the stack.</p>\n<p>Global variables are stored in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_segment\">data segment</a> of the program. They have a fixed address that doesn&#8217;t change during execution. Therefore, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_segment#Text\">code segment</a> can include constant addresses and requires no space on the stack at all.</p>\n<p>Okay, so we can understand why we need a different syntax. Rust, as a modern systems programming language, wants to be very explicit about memory management.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s try again with <code>static</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"rust language-rust\">use chrono::Utc;\r\n\r\nstatic START_TIME: String = Utc::now().to_string();\r\n\r\npub fn main() {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>The compiler isn&#8217;t happy, yet:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"rust language-rust\">error[E0015]: calls in statics are limited to constant functions, tuple structs and tuple variants\r\n --&gt; src/main.rs:3:24\r\n  |\r\n3 | static start: String = Utc::now().to_string();\r\n  |                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hm, so the initialization value of a static variable can&#8217;t be computed at runtime. Then maybe just let it be uninitialized?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"rust language-rust\">use chrono::Utc;\r\n\r\nstatic START_TIME;\r\n\r\npub fn main() {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This yields a new error:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"rust language-rust\">Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)\r\nerror: free static item without body\r\n --&gt; src/main.rs:21:1\r\n  |\r\n3 | static START_TIME;\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-\r\n  |                  |\r\n  |                  help: provide a definition for the static: `= &lt;expr&gt;;`\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>So that doesn&#8217;t work either! All static values must be fully initialized and valid before any user code runs.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re coming over to Rust from another language, such as JavaScript or Python, this might seem unnecessarily restrictive. But any C++ guru can tell you stories about the <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/siof\">static initialization order fiasco</a>, which can lead to an undefined initialization order if we&#8217;re not careful.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"rust language-rust\">static A: u32 = foo();\r\nstatic B: u32 = foo();\r\nstatic C: u32 = A + B;\r\n\r\nfn foo() -&gt; u32 {\r\n    C + 1\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    println!(\"A: {} B: {} C: {}\", A, B, C);\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this code snippet, there&#8217;s no safe initialization order, due to circular dependencies.</p>\n<p>If it were C++, which doesn&#8217;t care about safety, the result would be <code>A: 1 B: 1 C: 2</code>. It zero-initializes before any code runs and then the order is defined from top-to-bottom within each compilation unit.</p>\n<p>At least it&#8217;s defined what the result is. However, the &#8220;fiasco&#8221; starts when the static variables are from different <code>.cpp</code> files, and therefore different compilation units. Then the order is undefined and usually depends on the order of the files in the compilation command line.</p>\n<p>In Rust, zero-initializing is not a thing. After all, zero is an invalid value for many types, such as <code>Box</code>. Furthermore, in Rust, we don&#8217;t accept weird ordering issues. As long as we stay away from <code>unsafe</code>, the compiler should only allow us to write sane code. And that&#8217;s why the compiler prevents us from using straightforward runtime initialization.</p>\n<p>But can I circumvent initialization by using <code>None</code>, the equivalent of a null-pointer? At least this is all in accordance with the Rust type system. Surely I can just move the initialization to the top of the main function, right?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"rust language-rust\">static mut START_TIME: Option&lt;String&gt; = None;\r\n\r\npub fn main() {\r\n    START_TIME = Some(Utc::now().to_string());\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Ah, well, the error we get is…</p>\n<pre><code class=\"rust language-rust\">error[E0133]: use of mutable static is unsafe and requires unsafe function or block\r\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:24:5\r\n  |\r\n6 |     START_TIME = Some(Utc::now().to_string());\r\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^ use of mutable static\r\n  |\r\n  = note: mutable statics can be mutated by multiple threads: aliasing violations or data races will cause undefined behavior\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point, I could wrap it in an <code>unsafe{...}</code> block and it would work. Sometimes, this is a valid strategy. Maybe to test if the remainder of the code works as expected. But it&#8217;s not the idiomatic solution I want to show you. So let&#8217;s explore solutions that are guaranteed to be safe by the compiler.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/rust-global-variables/?utm_source=rss\">How to Idiomatically Use Global Variables in Rust</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

This tutorial will teach you how to properly create a fully working Python development environment using industry-accepted best practices.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"virtualenvironments\">Virtual Environments</h2>\n<p>A virtual environment helps us to solve project dependency conflicts by creating isolated environments. These &#8220;isolated environments&#8221; contain all the goodies Python programmers might need to develop their projects.</p>\n<p>Virtual environments include a fresh duplicate of Python binaries, and a standalone copy of the entire Python standard library. That&#8217;s why it can work by itself.</p>\n<p>Using virtual environments give us the following advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we&#8217;re able to maintain our local machine packages intact</li>\n<li>we can share dependencies with others with a <code>requirements.txt</code> file</li>\n<li>we can deploy a Python app in a dedicated server (PythonAnyWhere, Heroku, and so forth)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"theneedforvirtualenvironments\">The Need for Virtual Environments</h3>\n<p>I use many libraries for my projects. Among them are three web application development frameworks, and there are other libraries I&#8217;d like to explore in future. This serves as the main argument that serious projects in Python depend on other packages written by other developers.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a Django developer, I&#8217;m confident you use <strong>Django rest framework</strong> to create powerful rest APIs, <strong>Django Debug Toolbar</strong> for gathering various debug information about the current request/response, <strong>Celery</strong> for taking care of real-time operations, and scheduling as well, and so on.</p>\n<p>For example, I rely heavily on the <code>requests</code> package for some of my projects, and a Django web application I&#8217;m currently working on depends on version 2.3.0. According to the official documentation, at the time of writing the latest version of this package is version 3.2.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s suppose I go ahead and install the latest version of the library on my Ubuntu machine because I need it for another project. Everything seems to work fine until I try to make use of my older project, which worked fine with 2.3.0. Suddenly, everything is broken.</p>\n<p>What happened? Maybe the API of the latest version of Django has changed since version 2.3.0? The reason doesn&#8217;t matter at this point, as my older project is broken and no longer works.  </p>\n<p>A conflict between two projects has been created. They make use of the same library, but they require different versions of it.</p>\n<p>Various packages solve this problem. Let&#8217;s see some that stand out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beforestarting\">Before Starting</h2>\n<p>In this tutorial, we&#8217;ll be using Python 3, so let&#8217;s start by checking your Python installation.</p>\n<p>To do this, open up a terminal — cmd/PowerShell on Windows — and type the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">python --version\r\n\r\nPython 3.9.5 # My result\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: Most macOS and Linux systems have Python installed. You can check the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html\">Python installation guide</a> if you&#8217;re using Windows.</em></p>\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t get a result of the form <code>Python 3.x</code> there are two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if this command returned a <code>Python 2.x</code> version, you&#8217;ll need to use <code>python3</code> along with this tutorial</li>\n<li>if you got an <code>Unknown command</code> error, try to run <code>python3</code>, and if you get another error, follow the Python installation guide</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can proof the existence of the <code>python3</code> binary by checking its version:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">python3 --version\r\n\r\nPython 3.9.5\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: if the command above worked, you&#8217;ll need to run <code>python3</code> instead of <code>python</code>.</em></p>\n<p>Now that you know which Python command runs on your machine, let&#8217;s get into virtual environments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"builtinvenvmodule\">Built-in <code>venv</code> Module</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s use the built-in Python <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\">venv module</a> to create your first virtual environment.</p>\n<p><em>Note: to use this module you need Python 3.3 or greater installed in your system.</em></p>\n<p>To create a Python virtual environment with <code>venv</code>, type the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">python -m venv virt1\r\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note: the <code>-m</code> flag means Python is running the built-in <code>venv</code> module as a script.</em></p>\n<p>This will create a virtual environment with the name of <code>virt1</code>, but this is just an argument. You can create the virtual environment with any name you want.</p>\n<p>Everything installed in the <code>virt1</code> directory won&#8217;t affect the global packages or system-wide installations, thus avoiding dependency conflicts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"activatingvirtualenvironments\">Activating Virtual Environments</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s crucial to know that each time we want to use a created virtual environment, we need to activate it with the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">source virt1/bin/activate\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This won&#8217;t work in every system, so you can check the table below to have a clear idea of which command to use:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Platform</th>\n<th>Shell</th>\n<th>Command to activate virtual environment</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>POSIX</td>\n<td>bash/zsh</td>\n<td>$ source (venv-name)/bin/activate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>fish</td>\n<td>$ source (venv-name)/bin/activate.fish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>csh/tcsh</td>\n<td>$ source (venv-name)/bin/activate.csh</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>PowerShell Core</td>\n<td>$ (venv-name)/bin/Activate.ps1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Windows</td>\n<td>cmd.exe</td>\n<td>C:> (venv-name)\\Scripts\\activate.bat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>PowerShell</td>\n<td>PS C:> (venv-name)\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>Note: the <code>$</code> sign on POSIX and the <code>C:&gt;</code>, <code>PS C:&gt;</code> signs on Windows aren&#8217;t part of the command.</em></p>\n<p>As you may notice, I&#8217;m using a bash shell in a POSIX (macOS and Linux), which is why I&#8217;m running the command above.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aftertheenvironmentiscreated\">After the environment is created</h3>\n<p>Once the virtual environment gets activated, the terminal prompt changes a bit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1624422509activated.png\" alt=\"Activated environment\" /></p>\n<p>The following command lets you deactivate the virtual environment:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">deactivate\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note how your terminal prompt has changed again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1624422510deactivated.png\" alt=\"Deactivated environment\" /></p>\n<p>Now activate your virtual environment again and use the <code>which</code> command to check the Python binary that&#8217;s being used:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">source virt1/bin/activate\r\nwhich python\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If everything worked well, you should get something similar to the following output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">/home/daniel/tests/python-tests/venvs/virt1/bin/python\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you <code>deactivate</code> and <code>which</code> again, you should get a different output:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">deactivate\r\n/usr/bin/python\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is because, when working inside a virtual environment, the binary copy placed inside that environment is being used. The same applies to packages.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/virtual-environments-python-made-easy/?utm_source=rss\">Virtual Environments in Python Made Easy</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "

Remove a Background in Photoshop with the Object Selection Tool</h2>\n<p>Perhaps one of the coolest features to have come to Photoshop is the new Object Selection tool, which is new to Photoshop 2022. The Object Selection tool utilizes Adobe Sensi AI technology to do basically all the work for you in selecting the subject in your photos. </p>\n<p>Open your photo in Photoshop and select the <strong>Object Selection</strong> tool in the toolbar on the left (in the same menu as Quick Selection Tool). From here, simply hover your cursor over your subject and wait for it to turn blue. (Move your cursor in tiny circles if it doesn&#8217;t immediately turn blue.) In an instant, your subject is ready to be selected and worked with. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636587546photoshop-objectselect.png\" alt=\"Remove a background in Photoshop using the new Object Selection tool\" /></p>\n<p>To remove the background from here, press the <kbd>shift</kbd> key while selecting all of the objects you&#8217;d like to keep in the photo. This will auto-select each object for you (showing you the marching ants around each object). Go to <strong>Select</strong> &gt; <strong>Inverse</strong> so that it inverts the selection (meaning that your background is now selected instead of your objects).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636588155photoshop-objectselect2.png\" alt=\"Remove a background in Photoshop: Object Selection tool selection\" /></p>\n<p>Depending on what you&#8217;re wanting the background to be (in my case, I just want it to be transparent), you&#8217;ll likely need to unlock your image so it&#8217;s no longer considered a background. Click the lock on the right side of the layer that has your image to unlock that layer. This should change the layer name to &#8220;Layer 0&#8221; if you have no other layers. To remove the background, click the <strong>Eraser Tool</strong> (making sure your brush is a large size) and start erasing the background.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1636588478photoshop-objectselect3.png\" alt=\"Remove a background in Photoshop: Object Selection tool eraser\" /></p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to worry about Photoshop losing the selections. If you ever need to reselect your objects, simply repeat the process of selecting the Object Selection tool and hover over your objects again.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn how to edit the resulting mask from Photoshop&#8217;s Object Selection tool (in case it didn&#8217;t get everything in the initial selection) <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/making-quick-selections.html\">click here</a> to read more about Object Selection tool.</p>\n<p><em>Photo credit: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/_ViDPYQXrdY\">Chris Hardy on Unsplash</a></em></p>\n<h2 id=\"2removeabackgroundinphotoshopwithquickaction\">2. Remove a Background in Photoshop with Quick Action</h2>\n<p><em>Best to use when: you&#8217;re doing it for you, you need it fast, and you&#8217;re not necessarily looking for perfection. Best to use with high contrast between subject and background, and when the subject has fairly simplistic lines.</em></p>\n<p>By far the quickest method discussed here is the built-in Photoshop <strong>Quick Action</strong> for removing backgrounds in Photoshop. This was introduced in Photoshop 2021 (in the Creative Cloud subscription) and provides a very fast way to remove backgrounds. </p>\n<p>With speed, however, comes less accuracy. Using Photoshop Quick Action will do most of the work for you, but the results may fall short of your expectations, depending on your image. If that’s the case, you can use any of the methods described here to polish up the result.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quickactionsteps\">Quick Action Steps:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>With your image open in Photoshop, right click your Background layer and click <strong>Duplicate Layer</strong>. In the dialog box that pops up, name your layer (calling it whatever you like) and click <strong>OK</strong>. Click the eye icon to the left of the original layer to turn that layer off.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure your Properties panel is open by going to <strong>Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Properties</strong>. (If it was already checked, there&#8217;s no need to click it; if it isn’t checked, click it to open it up on the right-hand side by default.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In your Layers panel, click your new layer. In the Properties panel (by default this should be above your Layers panel), click the <strong>Remove Background</strong> button under <strong>Quick Action</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1618950189Remove-Background-Quick-Action-1-Cropped-01.png\" alt=\"Remove Background in Photoshop using the Quick Action 1\" /></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The quick action has now removed the background, leaving your layer with a mask around the subject.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1618950645Remove-Background-Quick-Action-2-Cropped-01.png\" alt=\"Remove Background in Photoshop using the Quick Action 2\" /></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From here, you can make refinements by going into the mask and adjusting as needed (such as around the dog&#8217;s feet at the bottom left of the image).

Although they&#8217;ve been around for a while, many React developers avoid using them or employ them without knowing what they are. React Fragments are an entry-level but key feature, and every React developer should master them, regardless of their skill level. Also, considering how long they&#8217;ve been part of React, they can no longer be ignored.</strong> </p>\n<p>So, let’s see everything you need to master React Fragments, by diving into the Why, the What, the How, and the When.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyreactfragmentsexist\">Why React Fragments Exist</h2>\n<p>As stated in <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html#motivation\">the official React documentation</a>, returning more than one HTML element is a commonly desired behavior for React components. To achieve this, you must wrap all these elements with an HTML tag. This is because React requires that components return only one HTML element. The easiest solution would be to use a wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. From a logical point of view, this extra <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> can usually be considered irrelevant, but it does have consequences. First, by using this approach consistently, you&#8217;re making your DOM more nested, and consequently slower to be rendered. Second, such an approach can lead to invalid HTML, as you&#8217;re going to see.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say you have a <code>Table</code> component which renders an HTML table, whose columns are rendered with another component called <code>Columns</code>. Here&#8217;s the code you might use for this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function Table() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;table&gt;\r\n      &lt;tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;Columns /&gt;\r\n      &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Columns() {\r\n  return (\r\n    // the wrapper div used to return two &lt;td&gt; tags\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt;\r\n      &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would result in the following HTML to be rendered, which is invalid, because a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> can&#8217;t appear as a child of <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;table&gt;\r\n  &lt;tr&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt;\r\n      &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>React Fragments were introduced precisely to solve this problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatreactfragmentsare\">What React Fragments Are</h2>\n<p>React Fragments involve a special syntax that lets you group a list of HTML elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. In other words, React Fragments enable you to group multiple child components without introducing any unnecessary markup in the rendered HTML, offering a solution to the problem addressed before, and many others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtousethem\">How To Use Them</h2>\n<p>You can use React Fragments by wrapping your child elements to be returned by your component with a <code>&lt;React.Fragments&gt;</code> tag. Returning to the example above, the <code>Columns</code> component would be written as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function Columns() {\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;React.Fragment&gt;\r\n      &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt;\r\n      &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would cause the <code>Table</code> component to be translated into the following HTML:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;table&gt;\r\n  &lt;tr&gt;\r\n    &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt;\r\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, there&#8217;s no wrapping tag in the rendered HTML. Unlike what happened before, this won&#8217;t result in invalid HTML.</p>\n<p>React Fragments can also be employed with a short syntax, which looks like an empty tag: </p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function Columns() {\r\n  return (\r\n    // using &lt;&gt; is just like using &lt;React.Fragment&gt;\r\n    &lt;&gt;\r\n      &lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt;\r\n      &lt;td&gt;World&lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;/&gt;\r\n    // using &lt;/&gt; is just like using &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>This leads to the same result as the example above. So, keep in mind that the empty tag is a shorthand for <code>&lt;React.Fragment&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n            <p>\n              Continue reading\n              <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-fragments-introduction/?utm_source=rss\">React Fragments: A Simple Syntax to Improve Performance</a>\n              on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>.\n            </p>\n          "
